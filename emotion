        "news_content_translate_en": "The outbreak of pneumonia caused by the virus 2019-nCoV is \"important\", but not a global emergency. This is the conclusion reached by the committee on Thursday emergence of World Health Organization (WHO) agreed that, for now, will not declare a global alarm coronavirus Wuhan. \"This does not mean that it can not be done at another time,\" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, CEO of the agency.\nIt was the second day of meetings and the decision was not unanimous. The committee was divided: half of the 16 experts asked to take this exceptional measure, and the other half showed otherwise. \"Given the number of cases [over 600] and its severity [18 deaths], with a limited number of infections outside China and considering the efforts of the authorities of this country to contain the virus, we have decided that it is too early\" he said at a press conference broadcast from Geneva Didier Houssin, President of the emergency committee, who also added that wHO is ready to change his mind in the coming days if the situation requires.\nHoussin recalled that global warning is declared a historic event for an epidemic that can have an impact on affected countries. Previously, WHO took this measure only five times: before the outbreak of H1N1 (2009), the ebola in West Africa (2014) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2019), the polio in 2014 Zika virus in 2016.\nIt is an international emergency measure to contain the spread of a disease. Depending on the type of pathogen, its characteristics and its evolution, certain measures are taken. In the case of polio, for example, a disease well known, the main WHO recommendation was to ensure that all residents or who are expected to reside in Iraq (focus of the outbreak) received a dose of oral vaccine or intrmuscular against polio. The idea was to prevent travelers to become transmitters of the virus. Restricting traffic of both people and goods, it is another possible measures. Something he said Ghebreyesus is not recommended today in China, beyond the measures that have enacted local authorities, who took on his own initiative, not advice from WHO.\nMore similar the two diseases are known SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome,) and the MERS (respiratory syndrome Middle East, in English). The former also emerged in China, in 2002. This time there were about 8,000 infected, of whom approximately 10% died. The MERS emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and died 35% of those affected. It is early to draw conclusions in the case of the new virus in Wuhan, but so far the death rate is around 3%. Most of those who have died are men over 60 years with previous pathologies such as Ghebreyesus recalled Thursday.\nThe head of the WHO insisted that the failure to declare the global alarm does not mean that the body is not taken \"seriously\" the outbreak. \"Nothing is further from reality. We are following it minute by minute, working to contain the transmission between humans, coordinating our networks of experts, \"he said.\nExperts praised the transparency with which China is addressing the case and its speed: \"Detected because the country had a system for detecting respiratory diseases\". But the committee, in its official statement, also requests the Government to provide \"more information on risk management measures between governments, including systems crisis at the national, provincial and municipal levels, as well as other national measures\".\nWHO has asked other countries which remain alert, because \"it is likely that more cases appear, both within China and outside.\" To avoid infection, recommend basic measures among citizens, such as washing hands frequently or cover your mouth and nose with the forearm sneezing. The agency is already investigating vaccines that may be effective against this disease, something for which there is already journey through what is known about SARS and MERS.\nWHO experts recognized that a priority is to detect the source of the outbreak. Although some researchers have pointed snakes as a possible focus, \"there is no conclusive evidence\" of this. Experts agreed that there is still much that is not known of the disease, as the mechanism of transmission between humans, if you can manifest asymptomatically and even the severity of the ailment.",

Secondly, there are also frontline doctors under the pseudonym \"Xu Ping\" who believe that the outbreak of pneumonia will occur in the first tier cities on the 27th day of the \"return peak\" after the Spring Festival (the third day of the first year), and last until May this year.\nGuan Yi, director of the National Key Laboratory of new infectious diseases and director of the influenza research center of the University of Hong Kong, who was the first to isolate and identify SARS coronavirus during the SARS epidemic in 2003, said in an interview with caixin.com that the epidemic in Wuhan could not be compared with SARS at all, because the transmission route of SARS in that year was clear, and 60-70% of the infected people were from individual super communicators The broadcast chain is very clear, as long as the contacts of those few people can be blocked. However, the source of transmission has been fully spread, and the epidemiological investigation is difficult to carry out. He predicted that in addition to the geometric increase in control costs, the scale of infection would be much larger. \"Conservatively, the scale of infection may eventually be 10 times larger than that of SARS. He was afraid of it because it might be difficult to control.\nHe also criticized the local government for closing the city only after the golden period of prevention and control, which made the effect questionable. He explained that the Spring Festival was coming to an end, and the people in the city had rushed out of the city, and the golden period of prevention and control was over. These people who left the city without awareness and guidance of epidemic prevention \"may be mobile viruses\", while \"Wuhan connects nine provinces\", so \"the outbreak is certain In addition, if we miss the golden prevention and control period and the Spring Festival tide, some people will not do anything. \"The scale of this infection will be larger than that of SARS.\nThe upper level only focuses on image engineering to spread information about the epidemic situation\nGuan Yi, who was in Wuhan from the 21st to the 22nd, said local protective measures and awareness were inadequate. He pointed out that although the Beijing government has been talking for two days, the local health protection has not been upgraded at all. As usual, people go to the streets to buy new year's products. The streets are crowded, \"totally insensitive to the epidemic situation\"! The staff in charge of security check in the airport have a large number of contacts with passengers, but the girl with the box only wears a disposable mask, which he thinks is insufficient. After checking, he knows that the mask is prepared by the girl herself. In essence, \"it is worried that it will affect the image.\".\nThe \"face project\" of not wearing masks was also staged at the press conference of the national health and Health Commission on the 22nd, when reporters wearing masks were asked to remove them\n。 In addition, Hong Kong's leading officials did not wear masks even when they had coughs and held a press conference on the epidemic. They also said that people without symptoms did not need to wear masks. Many people are dissatisfied with the information that the epidemic is not serious when they call the radio station to respond to the program. \"Dong Sheng (former Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa) has asked people to wash their hands from time to time.\" this is to put political considerations above public safety, focus on political correctness, and follow Beijing's central government.\nWuhan is also not keen on sharing epidemic data. Guan Yi and his team arrived at the local area to help find the animal source of the virus and establish cooperation in epidemic prevention. However, there are not many scientific research institutions willing to cooperate with him. \"I've had a lot of shut ups.\" more importantly, the authorities closed down and washed the South China seafood market, which broke out new pneumonia. It's difficult to trace the animal source, because they can't find it An animal with a virus will blame it as the culprit, which requires scientific analysis such as scale and system.\n",

There is no vaccine or specific treatment for the new virus.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday it had 63 patients under investigation, with two confirmed cases, both in people who had traveled to Wuhan.\nFollowing a congressional briefing by health officials, Republican U.S. Senator John Barrasso, a former physician, said people in the United States with the virus may have been infected up to 14 days ago in China.\n“We want to try to stop and prevent people from coming to the United States if they have it,” Barrasso told reporters, without providing details of how that might be accomplished\n.\nAirports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China.\nThe newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because there are still many unknowns surrounding it such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people.\nIt can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases.\nSymptoms include fever, difficulty breathing and coughing. Most of the fatalities have been in elderly patients, many with pre-existing medical conditions, the World Health Organization said.\nAs of Thursday, China’s National Health Commission said there were 830 confirmed cases and 26 deaths.\nMost cases have been in Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated in a market that traded illegally in wildlife.\nAs China scrambles to contain the outbreak, it has suspended transportation in 10 cities in the central province of Hubei, where Wuhan is located, the Hubei Daily reported.\nThe country will take further, more targeted measures, state television reported, citing a State Council meeting on Friday. It did not give further details.\n“Local authorities should take more responsibility and have a stronger sense of urgency,” state broadcaster CCTV said.\nWeek-long celebrations to welcome the Year of the Rat began on Friday, raising fears that the infection rate could accelerate as hundreds of millions of people travel to see family at home and abroad.\nIn Wuhan, a handful of people got off a high-speed train that pulled into the city’s station on Friday but nobody boarded.\n“What choice do I have? It’s Chinese New Year. We have to see our family,” said a man getting off the train who gave his family name Hu.\nAs part of the restrictions, some sections of the Great Wall near Beijing will be closed from Saturday, state media said.\nBeijing’s Lama Temple, where people traditionally make offerings for the new year, has closed, as have some other temples and the Forbidden City, the capital’s most famous tourist attraction\n.\nShanghai Disneyland will close starting on Saturday. The theme park has a 100,000 daily capacity and sold out during last year’s new year holiday.\nFilm premieres have been postponed and McDonald’s suspended business in five cities in Hubei province.\n“There’s so much news, so much data, every 10 minutes there’s an update, it’s frightening, especially for people like us in a severely hit area,” Lily Jin, 30, a resident of Wuhan, told Reuters by phone.\nThe WHO said on Thursday it was a “bit too early” to designate the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, which would require countries to step up their response.\nThat decision could well be reassessed in coming days as the situation evolves, said Anthony Fauci, the U.S. National Institutes of Health’s top infectious disease official, adding that it was “open to question” whether shutting down travel would have a major effect.\n“The mass involuntary quarantine in Wuhan and its neighboring cities is counterproductive,” added Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University Law School in Washington. “A lockdown of Wuhan will drive the epidemic underground, provoking fear and panic.”\nSome experts believe the virus is not as dangerous as the one that caused the 2002-03 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which also began in China and killed nearly 800 people, or the one that caused Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which has killed more than 700 people since 2012.\nThree international research teams - using different approaches - have begun work on vaccines, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations said.\nMarkets have been roiled this week on fears that the outbreak will curb travel and hurt economic demand. Shares in luxury goods companies have been particularly hard hit on fears of a drop in demand from China.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "BEIJING (Reuters) - A new coronavirus that has killed 26 people in China was confirmed in Europe for the first time on Friday as it spreads despite Chinese attempts to quarantine the city at the heart of the outbreak.\nChina closed Shanghai Disneyland and part of the Great Wall and suspended public transportation in 10 cities as it rushed to contain the virus, stranding millions of people at the start of the country’s Lunar New Year holiday.\nFrance reported two cases on Friday evening, the first ones discovered in Europe. More were likely, Health Minister Agnes Buzyn said.\nWuhan, a city of 11 million where the virus was first identified, is in virtual lockdown. Nearly all flights at Wuhan’s airport have been canceled and checkpoints block the main roads leading out of town.\nAs the city slides into isolation, pharmacies have begun to run out of supplies and hospitals have been flooded with nervous residents. The city is rushing to build a 1,000-bed hospital by Monday, state media said.\nDespite the lockdown, the virus is already spreading further afield.\nThe vast majority of the cases and all of the deaths have been in China, but it has also been detected in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Nepal and the United States. There is no vaccine or specific treatment for the new virus.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday it had 63 patients under investigation, with two confirmed cases, both in people who had traveled to Wuhan.\nFollowing a congressional briefing by health officials, Republican U.S. Senator John Barrasso, a former physician, said people in the United States with the virus may have been infected up to 14 days ago in China.\n“We want to try to stop and prevent people from coming to the United States if they have it,” Barrasso told reporters, without providing details of how that might be accomplished\n.\nAirports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China.\nThe newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because there are still many unknowns surrounding it such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people.\nIt can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases.\nSymptoms include fever, difficulty breathing and coughing. Most of the fatalities have been in elderly patients, many with pre-existing medical conditions, the World Health Organization said.\nAs of Thursday, China’s National Health Commission said there were 830 confirmed cases and 26 deaths.\nMost cases have been in Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated in a market that traded illegally in wildlife.\nAs China scrambles to contain the outbreak, it has suspended transportation in 10 cities in the central province of Hubei, where Wuhan is located, the Hubei Daily reported.\nThe country will take further, more targeted measures, state television reported, citing a State Council meeting on Friday. It did not give further details.\n“Local authorities should take more responsibility and have a stronger sense of urgency,” state broadcaster CCTV said.\nWeek-long celebrations to welcome the Year of the Rat began on Friday, raising fears that the infection rate could accelerate as hundreds of millions of people travel to see family at home and abroad.\nIn Wuhan, a handful of people got off a high-speed train that pulled into the city’s station on Friday but nobody boarded.\n“What choice do I have? It’s Chinese New Year. We have to see our family,” said a man getting off the train who gave his family name Hu.\nAs part of the restrictions, some sections of the Great Wall near Beijing will be closed from Saturday, state media said.\nBeijing’s Lama Temple, where people traditionally make offerings for the new year, has closed, as have some other temples and the Forbidden City, the capital’s most famous tourist attraction\n.\nShanghai Disneyland will close starting on Saturday. The theme park has a 100,000 daily capacity and sold out during last year’s new year holiday.\nFilm premieres have been postponed and McDonald’s suspended business in five cities in Hubei province.\n“There’s so much news, so much data, every 10 minutes there’s an update, it’s frightening, especially for people like us in a severely hit area,” Lily Jin, 30, a resident of Wuhan, told Reuters by phone.\nThe WHO said on Thursday it was a “bit too early” to designate the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, which would require countries to step up their response.\nThat decision could well be reassessed in coming days as the situation evolves, said Anthony Fauci, the U.S. National Institutes of Health’s top infectious disease official, adding that it was “open to question” whether shutting down travel would have a major effect.\n“The mass involuntary quarantine in Wuhan and its neighboring cities is counterproductive,” added Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University Law School in Washington. “A lockdown of Wuhan will drive the epidemic underground, provoking fear and panic.”\nSome experts believe the virus is not as dangerous as the one that caused the 2002-03 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which also began in China and killed nearly 800 people, or the one that caused Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which has killed more than 700 people since 2012.\nThree international research teams - using different approaches - have begun work on vaccines, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations said.\nMarkets have been roiled this week on fears that the outbreak will curb travel and hurt economic demand.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan, China arouses global attention\nToday's French newspapers choose different pages to cover relevant topics. French newspaper \"Figaro\" marked \"the Chinese government to take large-scale isolation measures to block the virus\" report title. The reporter in Beijing first described the current situation of traffic control in Wuhan, and then pointed out that the decision of the government authorities surprised the local people as China ushered in the traditional new year. In the morning of the implementation of traffic control, when the expressways were not closed, many Wuhan residents fled in droves, forming a serious traffic jam. In the afternoon, with the closing of highways, people who failed to leave the city were forced to return. In a desolate urban area, vegetables, fruit counters and related products in pharmacies have been \"ransacked\". Local people feel left out, and they are exposing soaring prices on social networks. The rest of China seems to welcome Wuhan's traffic control measures, hoping to eliminate infectious diseases.\nThe report pointed out that this is the most severe measure taken by Beijing since the outbreak of the crisis under the close attention of the international community. The Chinese government said that the fight against the epidemic has now entered a \"critical\" stage. For the Communist Party system, this campaign is of vital importance. Some experts worry that the measures may be too late to contain the spread of the epidemic.\nIt also published an interview with berche, a professor at the Institut Pasteur in Lille, France, who said: humans are not immune to these viruses.\nTraffic control measures cause panic\nThe echo also published a report by its correspondent in Beijing that the Beijing government had a race against time, fearing that the virus would spread during the massive migration of tens of millions of people starting on Saturday. In addition, Beijing has called for the cancellation of major new year celebrations and the closing of the Forbidden City.\nWith the announcement of traffic control, many people in Wuhan rush to the railway station and airport, hoping to catch the last flight or train. Some experts criticized the slow response of Wuhan health authorities and missed the best time for disease prevention.\nHospitals are overcrowded\nAfter reporting on the situation of many people trapped by traffic control, the reporter of Liberation Daily in Beijing also disclosed that the picture of hospitals in the surrounding areas of Wuhan being overcrowded caused panic on the social network. More and more people question the ability of Wuhan public service to manage crisis\n。\nAccording to the report, although the whole country is immersed in a dignified atmosphere, Xi Jinping's new year's greetings and a series of reports on celebrating the new year in various cities are broadcast on Thursday evening's China national television program.\n\"Cross\" and \"humanity\" also reported and analyzed the traffic control and the spread of the epidemic in Wuhan.\nSino US trade war cease fire, and there are still discords\nIn addition, an article published in the echo revealed that the Sino US trade war was temporarily stalled, but there were still many discords. After 18 months of trade clashes, Washington and Beijing have reached a fragile ceasefire, the newspaper said. However, the trade war is not over, and the technology war has just begun. Although the leaders of the two countries agreed to open a new stage of China US relations, the agreement reached by the two sides only temporarily shelved their differences. It was a ceasefire, not a truce. In addition, this agreement is not enough to solve the structural problems of China's economy.\nThe report points out that the differences between the two countries in the fields of values and ideology are probably the key to the problem. On the one hand, for Beijing, the U.S. support for Hong Kong's protest movement and its exposure of Beijing's crackdown on Uighurs in Xinjiang have angered the Chinese government. On the other hand, for Washington, it is more difficult for the United States to defend friendly relations with Xi Jinping's autocratic government. In the camps of both sides, the position of keeping distance from each other is becoming stronger. In fact, the possibility of drawing a line between Washington and Beijing is beyond the economic realm.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Today is the Lunar New Year's Eve 2020. When Chinese people around the world are reunited and celebrating the festival, the infection of \"Wuhan pneumonia\" has always been a shadow. A few days ago, Taiwan was occupied. Please introduce Taiwan's prevention and treatment of pneumonia in Wuhan.\nThe first confirmed case of pneumonia in Wuhan, Taiwan, was found four days ago, on January 20. A 55 year old female Taiwanese businessman, who usually works in Wuhan as an educator, suffered from fever, cough and sore throat on January 11. She had never been to the South China seafood market, had never eaten wild game and related contact history. At first, she only bought traditional Chinese medicine to take. On the ninth day after the onset of the disease, that is, on January 20, she flew back to Taiwan to see a doctor. When she arrived at Taoyuan International Airport, Taiwan Health workers boarded the plane for quarantine inspection. The Taiwanese woman took the initiative to explain that she had symptoms, so she was isolated from the airport to the hospital all the way. After an emergency test, the next day (21) was diagnosed with Wuhan pneumonia.\nUntil yesterday, the Taiwanese businessman was in stable condition, without fever, diarrhea and normal breathing. She would only breathe a little while walking and continue to be treated in the negative pressure isolation ward of Taoyuan hospital. Because she wore a mask all the way on the plane, only when she took it off at dinner, the competent authority judged from the transmission ability and way of the coronavirus, and required 34 passengers in the same row as her and in the front and back rows, and 12 crew members, a total of 46 people, to self monitor their health status, and 14 days later to remove the tracking. This is the only confirmed case of pneumonia in Wuhan in Taiwan.\n● after the discovery of the first case of Wuhan pneumonia, what measures did Taiwan take to prevent it?\nOn the morning of the 22nd, Taiwan's Land Commission urgently invited the Tourism Bureau, the disease control department, the Immigration Department and other departments to hold a meeting to discuss the case of Wuhan's tourism group and Wuhan's individual tourism to Taiwan. As for the application from Hubei Province to Taiwan, the examination will be strengthened. If it has been approved to come to Taiwan for exchange, it is suggested to postpone it by dissuasion. Of course, Wuhan municipal authorities announced measures like \"closing the city\" on the 23rd, and the public transport was stopped. With the approval of the World Health Organization, Wuhan citizens are no longer easy to leave Wuhan\n。\nAs for the direct flights between Taiwan and Wuhan, do you want to suspend them? Because it's the spring festival right now, Taiwanese businessmen and Taiwanese students go to and from both sides of the Taiwan Strait very frequently, and Taiwan's Ministry of transport dare not easily suspend it, but China Airlines has announced that after the Spring Festival, from February 10 to 27, Taoyuan to Wuhan, six flights back and forth will be cancelled. But Huaxin airlines, a direct flight from Taipei Songshan to Wuhan, has remained normal.\nIn addition, there are two mainland airlines, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines, as well as direct flights from Wuhan to Taoyuan. Will they be grounded? According to the official regulations of Wuhan City, \"without special reasons, citizens should not leave Wuhan, and the airport and railway station are temporarily closed from Wuhan\". It seems that it is not easy for Wuhan to fly to other cities in the world, and Taiwan will not fly to Taiwan.\nEvery time there is a large-scale infectious disease in the world, Taiwan and the mainland begin to blame each other for attending the international conference. What's Taiwan's official saying this time?\nYes, this time is no exception. The World Health Organization (who) held a meeting on the 22nd to discuss the epidemic situation of pneumonia in Wuhan. The who invited all countries with confirmed cases to attend. Only Taiwan was not included in the invitation list. The Taiwan epidemic command center said that Taiwan has good experience in prevention and control, and they are very sorry that they were not invited. However, information will be obtained from Taiwan friendly countries to adjust and amend the control measures accordingly.\nAs a result, Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry, immediately said on the same day, \"no one cares more about the health of Taiwan compatriots than the central government of China.\". He said that the mainland health and Health Commission has taken the initiative to inform Taiwan of the epidemic information in time, and Taiwan experts have also visited Wuhan to investigate the epidemic. With regard to Taiwan's participation in WHO activities, he said that reasonable arrangements must be made through cross strait consultations under the principle of one China. However, \"according to the consensus reached between China and who, when necessary, who experts can go to Taiwan for investigation and timely assistance.\".\nIt is said that for the sake of the epidemic of pneumonia in Wuhan, Tsai ing Wen, President of Taiwan, held a national security meeting and made a public speech. What is the main explanation?\nTsai ing Wen mainly explained the improvement of the government's epidemic prevention measures to appease people's hearts. She especially called on China, as a member of the international community, to do its best to fulfill its international responsibility, make the epidemic open and transparent, and fully share the correct epidemic information with Taiwan, \"which is also beneficial to the Chinese people themselves.\" political considerations should not go beyond the people's protection\n。 She also called on who not to exclude Taiwan due to political factors. Taiwan is on the front line of global epidemic prevention, and who must have the space for Taiwan to participate.\nIn addition, Taiwan's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ou Jiang'an, bombarded China on the 23rd. She said that at the time of the sharp rise and continuous spread of pneumonia in Wuhan, the Chinese foreign ministry not only failed to share the actual information with Taiwan, but also carried out political operations as a \"central government\" to confuse international audio-visual and \"derogate China's national sovereignty and status\". The Ministry of foreign affairs of Taiwan of the Republic of China deeply regrets and condemns such abominable acts by China.\nShe also said that the Chinese government has no right to propose any arrangements to dwarfy Taiwan's status in response to Taiwan's participation in who. Only Taiwan's elected government can represent 23 million people in Taiwan and protect the health and human rights of the people in Taiwan.\nShe stressed that Taiwan is currently in the forefront of the global fight against new coronaviruses, calling on WHO to take medical professional consideration and eliminate political prejudice and invite Taiwan to participate in the WHO related epidemic prevention conferences, mechanisms and activities.\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "●今天是2020年农历除夕，全球华人在合家团圆，围炉过节之际，「武汉肺炎」的传染始终是一个挥不去的阴影。前几天，台湾也沦陷了，请你为听友介绍一下台湾对武汉肺炎的防治情况。\n台湾第一个武汉肺炎的确诊案例，是四天前，也就是1月20日发现的。一位55岁的女性台商，平时在武汉从事教育工作，1月11日出现发烧、咳嗽、喉咙痛的症状，她没有去过华南海鲜市场，也没有吃过野味和相关的接触史，起先她只购买成药服用，发病后第九天，也就是1月20日，她搭机要回台湾看病，抵达桃园国际机场的时候，台湾卫生人员登机检疫，这位女台商主动说明自己出现症状，所以从机场就一路隔离到医院，过紧急检验，第二天(21日)确诊就是武汉肺炎。\n到昨天为止，这位女台商状况稳定，没有发烧、腹泻，呼吸正常，只有走路时会有点喘，继续在桃园医院的负压隔离病房治疗中。因为她在飞机上全程戴口罩，只有吃饭时拿下，主管机关从冠状病毒的传播能力和途径判断，要求飞机上和她同一排以及前后两排的乘客共34人，和机组员12人，合计46人，要自我监测健康状况，十四天后才能解除追踪。这是台湾目前唯一的武汉肺炎确诊案例。\n●发现武汉肺炎的第一个案例之后，台湾官方采取什么措施，加以防范呢？\n21日女台商确诊是武汉肺炎之后，台湾陆委会22日上午紧急邀集观光局、疾管署、移民署等开会研商，宣布暂缓武汉的旅游团来台，及武汉个人旅游来台；至于从湖北省来台的申请案则会加强审核；之前已经核准来台交流的，以劝阻方式建议其延后来台。当然，23日武汉市当局宣布了类似「封城」的措施，大众交通工具停驶，得到世界卫生组织的认同，武汉市民现在已经不容易离开武汉了。\n至于台湾和武汉之间有直航班机，要不要暂停呢？因为现在刚好是春节，台商、台生往返两岸非常频繁，台湾交通部不敢轻易暂停，但华航已经宣布，春节过后，二月十日到二十七日，桃园到武汉，来回六个航班取消。不过华信航空，从台北松山到武汉的直航班机维持正常。\n另外还有两家大陆的航空公司东方航空、南方航空，也有武汉到桃园的直航航线，他们会不会停飞呢？武汉市官方的规定是，「无特殊原因，市民不要离开武汉，机场、火车站离汉通道暂时关闭」，这样看起来，武汉的飞机飞到世界其他城市都不容易，台湾也不会飞到台湾了。\n●每次国际间发生大规模的传染病，台湾和大陆之间，就开始针对出席国际会议的问题互相指责，台湾官方这次有什么说法呢？\n没错，这次也不例外。世界卫生组织WHO在22日开会讨论武汉肺炎的疫情，WHO邀请了所有有确诊病例的国家出席，只有台湾不在邀请名单内。台湾疫情指挥中心说，台湾有很好的防治经验，没有受邀，他们非常遗憾。但会透过对台湾友好的国家取得讯息，据此调整修正管制措施。\n结果，中国外交部发言人耿爽当天立刻表示，「没有人比中国中央政府更关心台湾同胞的健康」。他说，大陆卫健委已经及时主动向台湾通报疫情讯息，台湾专家也前往武汉考察疫情。关于台湾参与世卫组织（WHO）活动，他说，必须在一中原则下经过两岸协商，做出合情合理安排，不过，「根据中方同世卫组织达成的共识，有需要时世卫组织的专家，可以前往台湾地区考察和及时援助」。\n●据说为了武汉肺炎的疫情，台湾总统蔡英文召开了国安会议，并公开发表谈话，主要说明什么呢？\n蔡英文主要说明政府的各项防疫措施的完善，以安抚人心，她并特别呼吁，作为国际社群的一份子，希望中国能善尽国际责任，让疫情公开透明，并且与台湾充分共享正确的疫情信息，「这对中国人民本身也是有利的」，政治考虑不应超越人民的保障。她也呼吁WHO不应因政治因素排除台湾，台湾就在全球防疫的第一线，WHO必须要有台湾参与的空间。\n另外，台湾外交部发言人欧江安23日更炮轰中国，她说，中国外交部在武汉肺炎疫情急剧升高且持续向外扩散之际，不但没有跟台湾据实分享疫情情资，还以「中央政府」自居，进行政治操作，企图混淆国际视听，「贬损我国国家主权及地位」。中华民国台湾外交部对中国类此恶劣行径深表遗憾，并予以谴责。\n她还说，中国政府无权针对台湾参与WHO而提出任何矮化台湾地位的安排，唯有台湾民选政府能代表台湾2300万名人民，以及守护台湾人民的健康人权。\n她强调，台湾目前位于全球对抗新型冠状病毒的最前线，呼吁WHO秉持医卫专业考虑，摒除政治偏见，邀请台湾参与WHO体系防疫相关会议、机制与活动。\n",

The crisis Wuhan coronavirus seems increasingly become more serious and civil servants in that city, the epicenter of the infection, recognize that medical supplies are reaching levels too low. The number of cases on its territory and reaches 56 dead and more than 1,700 infected, a figure that can go further because another 2,000 suspected. Among the dead is one of the doctors who treated these patients in Wuhan, a doctor identified as Liang Wudong, 62.\nLiang, a specialist in respiratory diseases Hubei Xinhua hospital, had begun to show symptoms of -cough disease, high fever, shortness of breathe a week ago, as explained colleagues to local media, and was been entered since .\nThe death of the doctor has highlighted the risks they are exposing personal physician Wuhan and 13 other cities in Hubei Province, which are enclosed by quarantine a total of 46 million people. Health authorities had already confirmed for days that among infected 15 doctors and nurses were all but one patient infected one, a man that he underwent brain surgery. Thursday also killed by cardiac arrest while attending sick, another doctor, Jiang Jijun, a specialist in infectious diseases.\nHospitals overflow is palpable in many videos circulating on social media despite censorship. In one can see a nurse weeps exhaustion; in another, a woman who is also described as a nurse denounces the presence of three bodies in a corridor that nobody has time to withdraw. In other some waiting rooms are fully saturated. Some hospitals have begun to turn away patients because of the impossibility to address them.\nIt's not just exhaustion. Levels of supplies to treat the sick are declining alarm levels, to the extent that public hospitals have launched an appeal for donations. They ask masks, surgical gowns, disinfectants, protective goggles. Supplies, according to published state-owned newspaper The Paper, only go for three or five days. A provincial official quoted by Reuters acknowledged that the reserves of such materials are at very low levels and the crisis continues at serious levels. According to this official, so far they have received donations of 1.2 million masks and 30 million yuan (more than four million euros).\nIn a sign of the importance of the crisis, Chinese President Xi Jinping presided over Saturday in a New Year's Day than any other had now been absolute inactivity, a meeting of the Politburo, the governing body of the Communist Party dedicated specifically to the study of measures. Materials supply Hubei and Wuhan should be ensured, insisted leaders, according to state television CCTV.\nTo try to fill the gaps as quickly as possible, and an indication of the urgency of the situation, Wuhan built hastily in two weeks, a second hospital dedicated exclusively to patients of the coronavirus, with capacity for 1,300 beds. This center, as revealed by the Journal of the People, will add to the already announced Friday it has started to be built with prefabricated modules and is scheduled to complete within 10 days, to bring a thousand beds.\nIn addition, the National Health Commission Hubei has sent more than 1,200 healthcare professionals from the rest of the country. The Chinese military has also shifted a contingent of 450 military doctors, some of them experts in the fight against Ebola in Africa or against SARS, the respiratory syndrome caused by a coronavirus family today and in 2003 killed more than 700 people. Xinhua News Agency also ensures that the network has strengthened masks and food supplies, among other products, to Wuhan. A first shipment of two million masks was ready for shipment this Saturday.\nAnd to encourage 11 million people in Wuhan to remain at home and thus avoid contagion, the municipal government has announced a ban on road traffic in the central area of ​​the city after midnight. Circular may only specially authorized vehicles for emergencies or to be responsible for transporting food and medicine to those who are handicapped, always following the approval of a neighborhood committee.\nThe contagion has now spread to a dozen countries on four continents: France, which has confirmed three cases on its soil, it was the first in Europe. Australia and Malaysia have also confirmed its first positive, that already observed in the United States, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Nepal, Singapore and Thailand account for more than thirty.\nIn China, the coronavirus and spans all provinces except Tibet. The youngest patient is a child of two years, in the southern region of Guangxi. But the vast majority are located in Hubei Province.\nOn Friday, the governor of Hubei, Jiang Chaoliang stressed that Wuhan should \"make every effort\" to increase the number of beds and isolation rooms for possible cases. Detection is complicated, warns a group of scientists in a study published Friday in the medical journal The Lancet, because some of the carriers of the virus do not show the classic symptoms of fatigue, fever or difficulty breathing.\nThe situation has overshadowed the celebrations of the Lunar New Year, the most important day in the Chinese calendar celebrations. With the vast majority of public events canceled, many places of entertainment closed and the recommendation of the health authorities to avoid the crowds and travel, the atmosphere is far from the usual jubilation. The streets of major cities are deserted; pedestrians is difficult to find without a mask. Beijing announced the suspension of its services interprovincial buses, among its measures to prevent contagion. The Chinese government has also decided to suspend travel organized abroad, according to state television announced. From Monday, Chinese travel agencies can sell no hotel reservations and group travel,\nIn total 18 provinces of the 30 counts with mainland China, they have declared the highest level of health emergency. Hong Kong, which have been detected five other suspected infections and 107, has joined Saturday that measure, which allows you to cancel public events and quarantining those arriving. The autonomous Chinese territory, as has announced his chief of local government, Carrie Lam, will extend two weeks school holidays for New Year to avoid contagion risks to children. also canceled until further notice flights and rail routes that connect the former British colony with Wuhan.\nWuhan coronavirus, provisionally known as 2019-nCoV, can cause symptoms similar to the common flu, such as cough, fever and difficulty breathing, which can lead to pneumonia.",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Novel coronavirus, also called Wuhan virus, remains an enigma more than a month after its outbreak in one of China's economic hubs, Wuhan. Doctors and scientists world over have put their heads down to understand the new coronavirus which was first reported to infect humans in December last year.\nIn official count, the 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has infected more than 17,000 people with over 350 deaths. However, some independent researchers have claimed that despite Chinese President Xi Jinping's thrust-statement asking officials to accurately report coronavirus cases, there has been massive underreporting from various cities in China, including Wuhanthe epicentre of the outbreak.\nThe independent, and hence unverified, claims put the number of coronavirus infected people in the range of 75,000 as on January 25.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has, after initial reluctance, declared the outbreak a global emergency. Though more than 99 per cent of coronavirus patients are in China itself, travellers have taken the Wuhan virus to other countries as well.\nCountries such as India and the US have imposed restriction on people coming from China. India has put on hold e-visas to Chinese people or foreign nationals coming to India from China till further orders. The US has temporarily banned entry of foreign nationals who have travelled to China over the past two weeks.\nAll this is aimed at containing spread of coronavirus outbreak in their countries.\nThe novel coronavirus entered human body from a fish and animal market in Wuhan, as reported by China. It spreads from one infected human to another through physical contact and droplets inhaled during respiration.\nDoctors, using computer modelling have found that one infected person can spread novel coronavirus to 2.5 persons before she flushes the pathogen out of her/his body\n. However, the fact that the coronavirus could not be contained despite total shutdown in Wuhan has led many to argue that the R0 (the ability to infect) is more than 2.5.\nBased on available evidence, the only good thing about coronavirus outbreak is its comparatively lower fatality rate. In the case of SARS outbreak in 2002-03, the mortality rate was around 10 per cent. In the current coronavirus outbreak, through about 25 per cent patients are showing severe respiratory problems, the fatality rate is only around 2-3 per cent.\nBut this comes with a warning that the coronavirus outbreak is yet not in its waning phase. The cases are still rising at a fast pace -- in some regions in China the rate of spread has been reported to be as high as 25 per cent in 24 hours.\nStill, if patients consult doctors in time, coronavirus is much milder than other viral outbreaks.\nIn the case of Ebola outbreak in Africa, the fatality rate was up to 90 per cent. Incidentally, common flu, or seasonal fever as it is known in common parlance in India, is estimated to kill around 4 lakh people every year. But its fatality rate is 0.1 per cent.\nCoronavirus becomes dangerous because it is new and key information such as incubation period and ways in which it can spread are not conclusively known. Its incubation period is estimated to be anywhere between two and 10 days.\nIt is also not certain that a respiratory mask or a face or surgical mask can actually prevent a healthy person from contracting coronavirus. It is curious that the World Health Organisation does not list wearing mask as a preventive measure in the case of novel coronavirus outbreak.\nFurther, another key aspect whether an infected person who is not showing any symptom of novel coronavirus infection -- cold, cough, pneumonia etc -- can infect another person is not known.\nScientists world over are studying the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus published by Chinese authorities in early January\n. This is expected to give a clue what medicine can work to contain this coronavirus outbreak.\nThere is a catch hereall viruses undergo mutation at a faster pace than other pathogens. The scientific study is anyway expected to lead to vaccine production and animal testing not before one year from now.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Coronavirus is a global scare now. There are no signs yet that the outbreak of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has been contained in Wuhan, the epicentre of the epidemic in China.\nThe fact that the administration has been selective in providing information to international agencies and media -- despite Chinese President Xi Jinping's public statement of keeping the fight against coronavirus outbreak a transparent affair - misinformation has taken the centre-stage on social media.\nMany conspiracy theories are doing rounds on Facebook, Twitter WhatsApp and their Chinese parallels.\nScientific magazine Nature has quoted international health workers as saying that the case-report data that are being released by the Chinese authorities are incomplete. Researchers are struggling to accurately model the outbreak and predict how it might unfold.\nThis has given a field day to misinformation - due to lack of credible information - and conspiracy theories attributing the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak to leakage of biological weapon and what Chinese people eat.\nA LEAKAGE OF BIO-WEAPON\nThis could be a case of fear-mongering at a time when health authorities around the world are on tenterhooks over the outbreak of coronavirus infection spreading from Hubei province of China.\nThat \"mystery\" lab is the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Wuhan is the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. The former Israeli spy has been identified in the reports as an expert in virology (study of viruses) and claims that the Wuhan Institute of Virology had been engaged in development of secret biological weapon for Chinese military.\nHowever, no health agency has backed their claim, which continued to gain traction from the fact that the authorities have pinpointed the source of Novel coronavirus -- from animals to humans - in a fish and animal market some 25-30 km from the virology lab\n.\nIt was in this fish and animal market that the coronavirus is believed to have infected humans first in early December. But alarm bells started ringing only on January 20, when 14 health workers treating pneumonia patients were reported ill. This was the first instance when human-to-human infection of coronavirus was confirmed in the current outbreak.\nESPIONAGE WITH CANADA CONNECTION\nAnother widely circulated theory of the coronavirus outbreak emerges from the sacking of two Chinese scientist couple working with the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg, Canada.\nThey along with their students had been sacked last year and escorted out of the building of the Winnipeg lab for suspected policy breach.\nNow, many social media influencers are claiming that the Chinese scientists had sent coronavirus to Wuhan lab, the only Level-4 lab in China, last year.\nThe coronavirus escaped the Wuhan lab, it is being claimed, largely because the Chinese scientists lacked expertise in dealing with this particular virus, which is highly mutable strand of RNA (ribonucleic acid, which is protein with genetic properties).\nPHARMA CONSPIRACY\nConspiracy theorists called it a planned outbreak for the gain of pharma companies involved with coronavirus vaccination. They linked it with Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is said to have funded both the Pirbright Institute and vaccine development.\nBAT SOUP\nOne video clip and a screengrab of it showing a woman eating bat are being circulated with claims that the current strand of coronavirus has reached humans due to the eating habits of the Chinese people.\nThe woman is heard saying in the video that the cooked bat tastes like chicken meat. Some factchekers have traced the video to a Palau in western Pacific Ocean, and dated some time in 2016. The video is completely unrelated to Wuhan coronavirus outbreak\n.\nThe fact that the authorities identified an animal market as the source of coronavirus outbreak and that bats could be a possible origin point have made people believe in misinformation coming with the old video.\nBIGGER THAN CHINESE PROJECTION\nThis is about 15 times more the figure of infected people put out by the Chinese government. According to official data, over 6,000 people have contracted the coronavirus infection and close to 130 deaths so far.\nThe video is said to be recorded by a nurse working in a Wuhan hospital. She is wearing a protective mask and does not identify herself as a health worker in the video, whose English translation is getting much traction on social media.\nThe authenticity of the video remains unverified mainly due to complete lockdown of Wuhan city and Hubei province of China.\nBut for the claim about the number of coronavirus infected people to be true, the R0 or R-naught need to be many times higher than what the World Health Organisation (WHO) said last week.\nR0 refers to the number of people that the virus tends to infect from an already infected person.\nThe WHO said the current corornavirus has an estimated R0 of 1.4 to 2.5. For 90,000 people to have been infected since the outbreak of coronavirus, R0 should be around 14-15.\n",

Here is what we know - and do not know - about the virus:\nThe coronavirus family of viruses includes the common cold and more serious diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).\nMany of those with the new virus who have died had pre-existing medical conditions or were elderly, those with weakened immune systems.\nCoronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, cough and breathing difficulties.\nStatistics from China indicate that about 2% of people infected with the new virus have died, suggesting it may be deadlier than seasonal flu but less deadly than SARS, which killed about 10% of infected individuals. The MERS outbreak in 2012 had a fatality rate of about 35%.\nScientists have labeled the new virus 2019-nCoV.\nThe virus can be transmitted via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes, and can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles.\nExperts have said it is more easily transmitted than the SARS virus. The incubation period is up to 14 days. People may be able to infect others before symptoms appear.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that people frequently wash hands, cover mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, and avoid close contact with those who are sick.\n“We recommend the use of masks for people who have symptoms ... because the virus transmits through droplets,” says medical expert Sylvie Briand.\nBut they do not guarantee protection against infection.\n“For people who don’t have symptoms, the mask in fact is not useful,” Briand says.\nThe American Centers for Disease Control’s advice is that face masks are not required for the general public.\nThere is no vaccine\n.\nChinese scientists were able to identify the genetic sequence of the new coronavirus and shared it publicly. Scientists in Australia have developed a lab-grown version of the virus, a step toward creating a vaccine.\nDrugmakers around the globe expect to begin testing experimental vaccines on humans in about three months.\nAbout 99% of the more than 20,000 cases have been reported in mainland China. Nearly 230 cases have been reported in about 27 other countries and regions, a Reuters tally based on official statements shows.\nAt least 490 people have died in China, most in and around the city of Wuhan, where the virus emerged late last year. One person has died in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines, both following visits to Wuhan.\nSingapore confirmed four more coronavirus cases on Feb. 5 taking its tally to 28. Thailand has 25 cases.\nIt took the new coronavirus 48 days to infect the first1,000 people. It took SARS 130 days to infect 1,000 people. It took MERS 2.5 years to infect 1,000 people.\nThe Chinese government has virtually locked down the central province of Hubei, home to 60 million people, and its capital Wuhan.\nChina is facing mounting isolation as airlines suspend flights to its cities.\nThe United States and Australia have banned entry to foreign nationals who have recently traveled to China.\nMany countries have evacuated their citizens from Hubei and are putting them in quarantine or isolation upon return.\nThe WHO has not recommended travel or trade curbs with China.\nIt is believed to have originated in a food market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife.

        "news_content_translate_en": "(Reuters) - A new coronavirus that has killed more than 130 people in China is spreading to other countries, alarming health experts.\nHere is some of what we know - and don’t know - about the virus:\nThe virus is believed to have originated late last year in a food market in the Chinese city of Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife. Health experts think it may have originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via another animal species.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) was alerted to several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan at the end of December. Chinese authorities confirmed they had identified a new virus a week later.\nThe new virus, identified by scientists as 2019-nCoV, is a coronavirus, a family of viruses that include the common cold and more serious diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).\nCoronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties.\nIt is unclear how deadly the new virus is. Although severe cases can cause pneumonia and death, there may be many cases of milder disease going undetected. Many of those who have died had pre-existing medical conditions or were elderly, those with weakened immune systems.\nThe new coronavirus can be transmitted from person to person, although it is not clear how easily that happens. Most cases so far are in people who have been in Wuhan, family members of those infected, or medical workers.\nTransmission is most likely through close contact with an infected person via particles in the air from coughing or sneezing, or by someone touching an infected person or object with the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose or eyes.\nIn order to reduce the likelihood of transmission, the WHO recommends that people frequently wash their hands, cover their mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, and avoid close contact with those who are sick.\nThe U.S\n. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says those who develop symptoms such as coughing and fever who have been in China in the last 14 days should call ahead to a healthcare professional to establish if they need to be tested.\nAll but around 70 of the more than 6,000 cases so far identified have been in China, mostly in and around Wuhan. The other countries with confirmed cases include Australia, Cambodia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea, the UAE, the United States, and Vietnam.\nThe WHO is looking very closely at cases of person-to-person transmission outside of Wuhan, which would suggest that it may have the potential to spread further.\nThe Chinese government has put Wuhan into virtual quarantine to try and stop the spread of the virus.

        "news_content_translate_en": "BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Residents of China’s Hubei province, where the new coronavirus outbreak was first reported, will be banned from entering Hong Kong from Monday as China tries to halt the rapid spread of the outbreak.\nChina’s Cabinet also announced it will extend the week-long Lunar New Year holiday by three days to Feb. 2 and schools will return from their break later than usual, state broadcaster CCTV said.\nHealth authorities around the world are racing to prevent a pandemic of the virus, which has infected more than 2,000 people in China and killed 56.\nA handful of cases of infection have been reported in other countries, including Thailand, Australia, the United States,  France and Canada. No fatalities have been recorded outside China.\nThe mayor of Wuhan, which is the capital of Hubei province and at epicenter of the outbreak, said he expected another 1,000 new patients in the city, which was stepping up construction of special hospitals.\nThe newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because much about it is still unknown, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases.\nChina’s National Health Commission Minister Ma Xiaowei said the incubation period for the virus can range from one to 14 days, during which infection can occur.\nThe Lunar New Year holiday, traditionally celebrated by hundreds of millions of Chinese traveling around the country and abroad to see family, began on Friday but has been severely disrupted by the outbreak.\nMa said China would intensify its containment efforts, which have so far included transport and travel curbs and cancellation of big events.\nThe virus, believed to have originated late last year in a seafood market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife, has spread to cities including Beijing and Shanghai\n.\nAlibaba’s Taobao online marketplace said it has removed sales of face masks from shops that show “unstable prices or false advertising”, as prices for the products surged.\nThe World Health Organization this week stopped short of calling the outbreak a global health emergency, but some health experts question whether China can contain the epidemic.\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was on his way to Beijing to meet officials and health experts dealing with the coronavirus.\nChinese-ruled Hong Kong, which has six confirmed cases, will also ban entry from Monday to people who have visited Hubei province in the past 14 days, the city’s government said. The rule does not apply to Hong Kong residents.\nHubei’s governor, Wang Xiaodong, said on Sunday he felt “agonized” and responsible for the outbreak. He described the situation as severe and said medical supplies were still tight.\nChina confirmed 2,051 cases of infection as of 7 p.m. (1100 GMT) on Jan. 26, while the death toll from the virus remained at 56, state broadcaster CCTV reported.\nAirports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China, although some health officials and experts have questioned the effectiveness of these efforts.\nHealth officials in Orange County, California, said a third case had been registered in the United States in a traveler from Wuhan, who was in isolation and in good condition.\nOn Sunday, China temporarily banned nationwide the sale of wildlife in markets, restaurants, and e-commerce platforms. Wild and often poached animals packed together in Chinese markets are blamed as incubators for viruses to evolve and jump the species barrier to humans.\nThe New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society called on China to make the ban permanent.\nThe U.S. State Department said it will relocate personnel at its Wuhan consulate to the United States, while Japan was working with China to arrange a charter flight for Japanese nationals to return from Wuhan\n. Around 50 Italians in Wuhan and the Hubei region were offered transport out.\nThe outbreak has prompted widening curbs on movements within China, with Wuhan, a city of 11 million, on virtual lockdown and  transport links all-but severed except for emergency vehicles.\nHealth authorities in Beijing urged people not to shake hands but instead salute using a traditional cupped-hand gesture. The advice was sent in a text message that went out to mobile phone users in the city on Sunday morning.\nBeijing also postponed the reopening of the city’s schools and universities after the Lunar New Year holiday, state radio reported. Hong Kong had already delayed the reopening of schools to Feb. 17.\nChina has called for transparency in managing the crisis,  after public trust was eroded by a cover-up of the spread of  SARS, a coronavirus that originated in China and killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003.\nBut officials in Wuhan have been criticized for their handling of the current outbreak.\n“People in my hometown all suspect the real infected patients number given by authorities,” said Violet Li, who lives in the Wuhan district where the seafood market is located.\nIllustrating the extent of disruption to life in China, overall passenger travel declined by nearly 29% on Saturday, the first day of the Lunar New Year, from a year earlier, with air passengers down nearly 42%, a transportation ministry official said.\nMany cinemas across China were closed and cruise ship operators canceled some sailings that had been due to leave Chinese ports.\nIn Hong Kong, Disneyland and Ocean Park were closed on Sunday. Shanghai Disneyland, which expected 100,000 visitors daily over the holiday, has already closed.\n(GRAPHIC: Spread of the new coronavirus - here)\n",

Test results on around 171 people from the cruise ship are still pending. The 10 new cases included four Japanese, two Americans, two Canadians, one person from New Zealand and one from Taiwan.\nCarnival’s Diamond Princess was caught up in the global coronavirus epidemic after an 80-year-old Hong Kong man tested positive for the virus after disembarking late last month. The ship arrived in Yokohama on Monday after a 14-day round trip.\nClyde and Renee Smith, a U.S. couple who are both 80 and on the cruise with two adult grandsons, said they were on a bus trip with the man in Kagoshima, southern Japan, but both tested negative for the virus.\nThey were enduring their second day in a stateroom that, as Renee told Reuters by phone from the ship, “is tiny, we don’t have a window, there are four of us - and only one chair.”\nThey’ve spent time reading and watching movies, including “Crazy Rich Asians” and “Aquaman.” Grandson Sawyer Smith, 25, a workout devotee, does crunches since he can’t visit the gym.\n“It’s not really to the point where we’re getting stir-crazy, if they keep us in the rooms for four to five days it might be a little different,” Sawyer said.\nOthers, though, were starting to feel confined\n.\nOne 43-year-old Hong Kong resident, also in a windowless room, said they had received food, toilet paper and games and art supplies for their child.\nBut it was sunlight they wanted, he said.\n“Wondering though when we can step outside the room, if at all, for sunlight,” the man, who declined to be named, told Reuters, adding he hadn’t been in direct sunlight since Tuesday.\n“I got a peek of it when the opposite room opened their door to receive breakfast, as that room has a balcony. The sky looked blue.”\nOther passengers said food delivery to the rooms was slow.\n“Of course, our greatest worry is that we have been infected,” said Gay Courter, a 75-year-old U.S. novelist.\n“We are hopeful that the U.S. government will be sending transport for the Americans on board it’s better for us to travel while healthy and also if we get sick to be treated in American hospitals.”\nConcern has also spread to ports the ship visited along the way, including Naha on Japan’s tropical Okinawa island and Taipei in Taiwan, where passengers went on day trips.\nA health official in Naha said they were trying to trace the path of the infected passengers, while Taipei’s National Palace Museum disinfected its exhibition rooms and Taiwan banned all cruise ships from making port.\nJapan is making arrangements to send a fourth chartered plane to Wuhan to pick up around 200 people on Thursday night, chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference. These are likely to include Chinese spouses as well as Japanese.\nThe virus death toll in mainland China hit 563 on Thursday, with almost 3,000 new cases reported.\nChina’s National Health Commission said another 3,694 coronavirus cases were reported throughout the country on Feb. 5, bringing the total to 28,018.\nNearly 260 cases have been reported in 31 other countries and regions outside mainland China, according to a Reuters tally based on official statements from the authorities involved\n.

        "news_content_translate_en": "The \"new coronavirus infection pneumonia spread early in Wuhan, China\" provides the most detailed epidemiological data on the rapidly spreading epidemic. The authors of this paper are experts from authoritative health institutions in China, and also have considerable administrative responsibilities, including Gao Fu, academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, director of China CDC, Feng Zijian, deputy director of China CDC, and Yang Bo, director of Hubei CDC.\nWhat caused much controversy is that the paper pointed out that in 2019, a new coronavirus appeared in Wuhan in mid December. \"The interpersonal communication between close contacts has occurred since mid December and has gradually spread in the following month.\" however, the Wuhan Municipal Health Protection Commission went straight to January 11th. It also said, \"no obvious human transmission phenomenon has been found.\" the 16 day renamed \"does not exclude limited persons.\" The possibility of a successor, but the risk of continuous human transmission is low \"; in addition, it is more controversial that the paper points out that in from January 1st to 11th and 12 to 22, there were 7 and 8 medical staff infected, but until 20, when Xi Jinping was formally addressing the epidemic, Zhong Nanshan, a Chinese epidemic prevention expert, was informed that 15 medical staff were infected when he was interviewed. The Wuhan Health Protection Committee was delayed 21 days before it informed the 15 medical staff of the new coronavirus infection.\nWang Liming, a professor at Zhejiang University, questioned on Weibo: \"this is the first time that I have seen clear evidence, and the evidence of human to human transmission of the new coronavirus has been deliberately concealed!\" the professor asked in an accusatory tone: \"it is the scientists of the CDC who, in order to publish their papers, do not publicize the data? Is the Wuhan municipal government suppressing data disclosure for some reasons? Or what? \" He further questioned: \"as a researcher with first-hand information, you know the exact information about human to human transmission three weeks earlier than the public. Have you done what you should do?\" His post has now been deleted.\nZhang Fengfeng, an epidemiologist at UCLA School of public health, told intellectuals that some Chinese scholars published articles in several internationally renowned magazines in a short period of time. From the data disclosed in the paper, it can be seen that many of them can be used to guide the control of this new infectious disease at the early stage of the outbreak.\nThe publication of this paper and the query of experts shocked the Internet. At the first time, these queries were almost directed at the researchers\n。 The core question that netizens question is when scientists knew when the 2019 new coronavirus would be transmitted to others. Why was it published in foreign periodicals instead of telling the truth to the domestic people earlier? Another is that scientists know that such a paper can not be published at home, so they can \"save the country by curving\" and \"disclose the truth abroad\". It seems obvious that it means to excuse scientists.\nIn the face of doubt, China CDC put forward four explanations on Friday, pointing out that the paper is based on the retrospective analysis of 425 confirmed cases reported as of January 23, and all cases have been released to the society before the paper was written. The 15 cases of infection of medical staff mentioned in the paper were also announced to the public by Zhong Nanshan and Wuhan health and Health Commission respectively from 20th to 21st; the viewpoint that human to human transmission occurred in December last year proposed in the paper \"is a retrospective inference based on the epidemiological investigation data of 425 cases\". Disease control experts use \"retrospective\" to explain that there is no problem that scientists have long known the epidemic and concealed the truth. Feng Zijian, deputy director of the center, was interviewed by the Beijing news about the infection of medical staff. One of the first doctors infected by Wuhan Union Medical College Hospital was hospitalized on January 16. Did the National Center for Disease Control and prevention not receive any information about the suspected infection of medical staff on that day? Feng Zijian said that \"it is not particularly clear\". The reporter asked whether the network direct report system of infectious diseases could directly reach the country within two hours Home level? Feng Zijian replied that \"the use of network direct report is not so early\", because Wuhan pneumonia is a new disease, and there is no infectious disease report in the directory. Adjusting the network direct report system settings requires a process of personnel training. All in all, he denied questions about the data being withheld by the CDC.\nAfter the controversy over the above-mentioned papers, there is also a view that we should not lose focus and focus on researchers. The root of the problem is power. On this point, even Zhou Xianwang, mayor of Wuhan, explained in an interview with CCTV why he didn't disclose the epidemic in time. He said, \"as a local government, I can only disclose it after I get this information and authorize it.\" after that, officials in Wuhan and Hubei made similar statements, which were derided by netizens as \"throwing the pot\".\nSome netizens think that the scientific papers reveal two key facts: one is that there are 425 confirmed cases in January, while 198 cases were published in Wuhan on January 20; the other is that human to human transmission was confirmed at the beginning of January, which was not published until the 20th of Beijing until the local government, which obviously exposed that the Communist Party of China is lying from top to bottom\n。\nA student who claimed to be academician Gao Fu came out to defend the National Center for Disease Control and prevention. He pointed out that the center for Disease Control and prevention formally participated in the epidemic on December 31, confirmed the level II and level I response on January 6, announced the level 8, announced the level 10 sequence and diagnostic reagents, and raised the level 15 to the highest level. The response of disease control met the standard. Another netizen wrote, \"is academician Gao Fu right? Not necessarily. As the director of the center for Disease Control and prevention, he didn't release the epidemic situation in time, and didn't raise the risk level of the virus in a more timely manner. All of these are Gaofu's pots, or at least some of them are his pots. But this is his mistake as an administrator, not as a researcher. \"\nOther netizens questioned why so many things pointed to technical experts and National Centers for Disease Control and prevention all at once in order to dump the pot for the highest level. Technical experts have no right to decide on information disclosure. The key to this epidemic is not to make it public in time. It is the power of the state to suppress the truth, which is still creating chaos.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "According to the introduction: radcivir is a new experimental broad-spectrum antiviral drug developed by Gilead science company of the United States, which is believed to effectively inhibit the replication of SARS virus and mers virus in respiratory epithelial cells. Although the drug is still in phase III clinical trials against the Ebola virus, the latest news shows that the drug takes effect immediately after being used in a patient infected with \"Wuhan pneumonia\" in the United States. The news came out that the Wuhan virus Institute immediately applied for patent for Reed's new version of the 2019 coronavirus. In addition, 270 samples of the drug were sent to Beijing China Japan Friendship Hospital for clinical trial of \"Wuhan pneumonia\" patients.\nOn Tuesday, the official website of the Wuhan Institute of Virology said that they had applied for a Chinese invention patent for the U.S. new drug readcivir, which had not been officially used yet, as early as January 21, while the day before January 21, the Chinese official just officially announced that Wuhan pneumonia is a serious human to human infectious disease. That is to say, the research on the efficacy of ridacivir by Wuhan Virus Research Institute has been carried out long before that. When Wu Han was ignorant and ignorant that he was at risk of infection, Wuhan's top Chinese Academy of Sciences Virus Research Institute had discovered an effective drug against new official coronavirus without official name.\nSure enough, Wuhan Virus Research Institute is not only mysterious, but also really awesome. Maybe it is really ahead of the virus. But this is where people's fear is now, and it also deepens the worries about the source of various viruses. Many people know that Wuhan Virus Research Institute is the highest level Virus Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, but they do not understand why in the process of the spread of Wuhan pneumonia virus, this institution is extremely low-key. Wuhan's mountains and rivers support this institution for virus research, but Wuhan people have become the biggest victims of the virus. After the outbreak was announced, many factors promoted the Wuhan Virus Research Institute, which was hidden in the boudoir, to the public, but it was still covered with mystery.\nAs for the rush to register and use patents, Wuhan Virus Research Institute may be motivated to show that it wants to contribute to the country, but it is puzzling because of the use of the term \"invention patent\". According to Free Asia report, the news ignited public opinion, and netizens left messages to discuss\n。 Some netizens said, \"do you know who has seized the treatment patent of\" ridacivir \"in China? Wuhan Virus Research Institute, together with military units, on January 21, rushed to \"use ridacivir to treat 2019 new coronavirus patent\", and spread the rights and interests to the world through international agreements. What kind of operation is this? \"\nSome netizens also pointed out that \"free drugs from the United States have been patented by Wuhan Virus Research Institute!\"! American free open molecular structure, to China's treatment of pneumonia medicine radcivir by the virus by the brand, Americans completely ignorant of it! Let's see how the snake killed the farmer! \"\nNetizens criticized and said, \"it's shameless! Take what others give painstakingly and selflessly, change it a little, and then become your own thing, and register for patent to make a lot of money. \" \"This is the most shameless thing in the world! We don't try our best to do real work for the anti epidemic situation. We really spend a lot of time on opportunism, striving for fame and wealth for ourselves, and stealing other people's achievements! It's disgusting! \" \"People all over the world know the fact that the Communist Party is not afraid that the whole world will be besieged and beaten when it plays with hooligans like this?\"\nRen Zhao, a Zhengzhou lawmaker, sent an open letter to Wuhan Virus Research Institute on Wednesday, urging it to disclose details of the virus research process. He said that many people had reported the management confusion of Wuhan Virus Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences under their real names, and then deleted the post. The licensing application includes the details of virus preservation and access to the Institute from 2019 to 2020, the details of research and development of coronavirus in the Institute, the detailed documents of research and development process and patent application of radcivir, and the research direction, published papers and detailed resumes of Professor Shi Zhengli in the Institute.\nAbout the source of the new crown pneumonia virus in Wuhan, Chinese officials have cited the source of the virus to the Southern China seafood wholesale market in Wuhan. But Indian researchers recently published a paper saying that four inserts of the new coronavirus were similar to HIV, and they suspected that the outbreak in China was related to the leakage of samples from Wuhan virus Institute.\nOn February 4, Xu Bo, chairman of the mainland's Duoyi network, tweeted that his real name had reliable evidence as a clue to report to Wuhan Virus Research Institute. Xu Bo cited some basic facts, and attached several evidence links such as \"paper published by Shi Zhengli of Wuhan Virus Research Institute\".\nXu Bo said that because the epidemic prevention is of great importance, it is suspected that Wuhan Virus Research Institute has mismanaged the experimental animals, causing the outflow of experimental animals, leading to the 2019 new coronavirus epidemic\n。 He also stressed, \"I clearly believe that the genetically modified virus developed by Shi Zhengli in 2015 is different from the new coronavirus in Wuhan, but there must be a large number of other similar viruses in his laboratory, and then there must be further research on similar viruses, which is the truth that should be investigated.\"\nThe White House's chief strategist, ban Nong, said on Monday (February 3rd) that the Chinese Communist Party lied about everything.

Cao Bin, the correspondence author and chief physician of respiratory and Critical Medicine Department of China Japan Friendship Hospital, also said in reply to science: \"it seems clear now that the seafood market in South China is not the only focus, but to be honest, we don't know where the virus comes from.\"\nAccording to the paper, the first case of new coronavirus infection in the hospital was recorded in December 1, 2019. There was no history of exposure to the seafood market in Southern China. No fever or respiratory symptoms were reported in the family. In December 10th, only 3 people were infected. Two of them did not have a history of exposure to the seafood market in Southern China. Of the top 41 patients admitted to Jinyintan hospital, only 27 had contact with the South China seafood market.\nAccording to the 26 China Disease Control and Prevention Center, 585 samples from Southern China seafood market detected 33 samples containing new coronavirus nucleic acids, and successfully isolated virus from positive environmental samples, suggesting that the virus originated from wild animals sold in Southern China seafood market. These positive samples were distributed in 22 stalls and 1 garbage truck on the market\n。\nTang Jinling, Professor of epidemiology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, was quoted as saying, \"there should be multiple sources of viruses in the South China seafood market at that time, and they are relatively scattered. Dozens of patients appear at the same time in a short period of time, and there is no history of contact with each other, indicating that the infected wild animals may not accidentally enter a stall, but enter multiple doors at the same time in a short period of time Shop, this can cause so many people at the same time. According to him, the virus may have become more common in wild animal infectious sources, which increases the possibility of these animals entering other markets or re entering the market and infecting human beings.\nAccording to the report, Tang Jinling said that the original birthplace may not be a point, but a large area, and there is the possibility of people passing on people. Considering that some of the initial infected people have no contact history with the seafood market in South China and have close contact history with the infected people, in addition to the seafood market in South China, it is also necessary to consider whether there is virus detection in other markets in Wuhan, so as to find out how large the scope of \"a large area\" is, so as to completely cut off the chance of reinfection of animals to human beings. But he also stressed that these assumptions are based on the limited information at present and need further investigation and verification.\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "据中央社今天报道说，柳叶刀期刊指出，武汉肺炎恐有多个疫源地。英国医学期刊“柳叶刀”近日发表的武汉肺炎研究论文指出，从中国武汉市金银潭医院收治的前41名患者情况来看，华南海鲜市场不是唯一的新型肺炎疫情起源地，可能是一大片有多个疫源地。\n该报道引述陆媒财新网消息指，柳叶刀期刊（Lancet）当地时间24日发表论文披露金银潭医院收治的前41名患者情况，文中一张图表显示，前4名感染者中有3人没有华南海鲜市场暴露史，这为一直被认为是疫源地的华南海鲜市场打上问号。报道引述论文第一作者、武汉市金银潭医院副院长黄朝林表示：“从现在整个发病情况来看，海鲜市场已经不是唯一的暴露源，（新型冠状病毒起源）是多源性”。论文通讯作者、中日友好医院呼吸与危重症医学科主任医师曹彬在回复科学杂志（Science）时也表示：“现在看起来很明确，华南海鲜市场不是唯一的疫源地，但说实话，我们还不知道病毒到底来自哪里。”\n根据论文，金银潭医院收治的首个感染新型冠状病毒患者发病日期为2019年12月1日，并没有华南海鲜市场暴露史，家人也未出现发烧和呼吸道症状；至12月10日，才另有3人发病，其中两人也没有华南海鲜市场暴露史。在金银潭医院收治的前41名患者中，仅有27名接触过华南海鲜市场。\n据中国疾病预防控制中心病毒病所26日称，从华南海鲜市场的585份环境样本中，检测到33份样品含有新型冠状病毒核酸，并成功在阳性环境标本中分离病毒，提示该病毒来源于华南海鲜市场销售的野生动物。这些阳性样本分布在市场上的22个摊位和1个垃圾车。\n报道引述香港中文大学流行病学教授唐金陵说，“华南海鲜市场当时应该存在病毒的多点来源，而且它们之间比较分散，几十个病人又短期内同时出现，且没有彼此接触的历史，说明感染的野生动物可能不是偶然性地进入了一家摊位，而是短期内同时进入了多家门店，这样才可能同时引起这么多人发病”。据他认为，该病毒在野生动物传染源里可能已经比较常见，这就增加了这些动物进入其他市场或再次进入市场，进而感染人类的可能性。\n报道称，唐金陵说，最初的发源地可能不是一个点，而是一大片，而且有人传人的可能性。考虑到初期感染者有部分没有华南海鲜市场接触史和感染者密切接触史，除华南海鲜市场外，还需考虑武汉其他市场有无病毒检出，以探明“一大片”的范围究竟有多大，以彻底切断动物再传染人类的机会。但他也强调，这些推测是基于目前有限的资料，正确与否需要进一步调查验证。\n",

His symptoms subsided the next day.Although a single case is no hard proof for the efficacy of the drug, a report published on Tuesday by scientists in China in the scientific journal Cell Research added to the excitement as it revealed that Remdesivir blocked the new coronavirus from infecting cells grown in the lab.China approved the registration for clinical trials on Remdesivir earlier this week and the first batch of pneumonia patients infected by the novel coronavirus have started taking the drug on Feb 6.“The clinical trials in China will be more robust and will provide better evidence of its effectiveness,” said  Lam, who is a senior fellow at the Academy of Science Malaysia. REMDESIVIR The drug was first developed by US biotech pharmaceutical giant Gilead Sciences to treat the Ebola virus and Marburg virus infection, but has shown to be a potential antiviral agent against coronaviruses such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in studies of infected mice and monkeys.Despite being still in the experimental stage, Remdesivir tested without ill effects in Ebola patients. However, it was not as effective against that virus, as Ebola is in a different family from coronaviruses.The drug has been shown to interfere with the replication of the virus upon gaining entry.“Remdesivir appears to act against the virus without becoming toxic for the cells. This makes them ideal candidates as antiviral agents,” Lam explained.He said that it was essential to identify effective antiviral agents to combat the disease as there are currently no effective approved treatment against the novel coronavirus illnesses.“In-vitro laboratory studies using cultured cells in test tubes have shown promise, and animal studies have also shown that these drugs are safe and Remdesivir can fight coronaviruses. Now, we need to conduct clinical trials in patients to show that they will work as well,” said Lam, who is also a research consultant at the University of Malaya (UM).Besides Remdesivir, other drugs being evaluated for treatment include chloroquine, ribavirin, interferon, penciclovir, nitazoxanide, nafamostat and favipiravir.Lam recalled that during the Nipah outbreak in 1998-1999, the UM Medical Centre used the experimental drug ribavirin in the treatment of acute Nipah encephalitis patients and showed that it was able to reduce the mortality of acute Nipah encephalitis.“Hopefully, ribavirin and other RNA inhibitors will also work on coronavirus patients,” he said.(RNA inhibitors are substances or drugs that prevent the virus ribonucleic acid from replicating, thereby preventing virus formation. Coronaviruses are RNA containing viruses.)China is also testing chloroquine along with other drugs. Chloroquine is a widely used anti-malarial and autoimmune disease drug and has been in use for more than 70 years. It has recently been reported to have a potential to act as a broad-spectrum antiviral drug by blocking virus entry into cells and preventing virus maturation in cells which are already infected.“It would be fantastic if chloroquine works against the new coronavirus. It is a drug which has been in use against malaria for years, and is known to be safe and cheap,” said Lam. THE TRIALSA Gilead spokesman, Ryan McKeel, was recently quoted in a news report saying that two clinical trials would take place in Wuhan, China involving 500 patients.The 500 would be given Remdesivir while comparison groups would get a placebo.Patients for the first trial would comprise those severely ill while the other trial would involve warded patients who are not as sick.The patients on Remdesivir would be given the drug intravenously for 10 days. After 28 days, they would be assessed to see how they fared against the placebo groups. -- BERNAMA  ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "On a cruise ship under quarantine in front of Japan 41 more passengers have contracted the Coronavirus. The Japanese authorities reported that the number of infected passengers had increased to 61. Earlier on, 20 patients had been taken off the Diamond Princess.\nAccording to the German Embassy in Tokyo, ten persons of German nationality are among the total of about 3.700 passengers and crew members of the cruise ship. According to the embassy, however, the Germans on board had not been infected, and they were doing well under the circumstances, the embassy said.\nThe Japanese authorities have the ship until 19th. In February, the virus was quarantined to prevent further spread on the mainland. In addition, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced that Japan would refuse entry to foreign passengers of another cruise ship with the aim of Japan. The reason for this was a suspicious case on board the Westerdam, which was on its way from Hong Kong to Okinawa. The new regulation will enter into force on Friday. Thousands of passengers and crew members were also isolated on another cruise ship anchored outside Hong Kong called World Dream.\nMost cases of Coronavirus occur in China. There the number of deaths increased to 636 until Friday, and more than 31.000 people with respiratory disease have become infected worldwide.\nPolitically sensitive to the Chinese government is the death of Doctor Li Wenliang, announced on Thursday. Li had warned early of the outbreak of the new virus. The death of the 34-year-old ophthalmologist, who died of lung disease himself on Thursday evening, has caused great sympathy throughout the country.\nYeah. With the agreement of the Party's Central Committee, the State Supervisory Commission sent an investigation team to Wuhan, as the authority announced on Friday.\nHis death symbolizes for many Chinese the consequences of inaction or slow reaction of the authorities to the outbreak. The investigation is about questions of the people about this incident, he said. Li Wenliang was in his 30s. In December, in an online discussion group of doctors and students, citing a growing number of mysterious viral outbreaks in Wuhan, warned of a recurrence of the Sars virus, which led 17-year ago to the pandemic of 8.000 infected and 774 dead.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, every third person has died of it.\nYeah. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment must be\nYeah. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nEight participants in the chat group were then summoned and warned by the police about the spread of \"rumors\". They also had to sign that they were not revealing anything more about the outbreak. A few days later, the doctor infected himself with a patient.\nThe number of new infections with the Coronavirus in China seems to have stabilised slightly, but remains very high. From Thursday to Friday, authorities reported more than 3.140 new cases, increasing the total number of confirmed diseases in China to 31.161. It was the second day in a row that the reported infections did not exceed those of the previous day. Within one day, however, 73 patients died again from the new type of lung disease, as many as the day before. So far there have been 636 Coronavirus deaths in China.\nWhether a further trend in infections can already be identified with the new figures is open, as statistics can also fluctuate with the number of ongoing investigations. In addition, more than 26.000 suspect cases are still registered. The course of the epidemic is difficult to predict from the point of view of the World Health Organisation. Outside the particularly affected areas in Central China, the situation in China seems to be relatively stable at the moment, said WHO expert Michael Ryan in Geneva\nYeah.\nA newborn in the city of Wuhan, the starting point of the virus, was found only 36 hours after birth. These are the most recent known patients.\n\"The baby was separated from its mother immediately after birth and fed artificially. There was no close contact with the parents, yet he was diagnosed with the disease,\"said Zeng Lingkong, director of neonatal diseases at Wuhan Children's Hospital, Chinese TV. Other sick mothers would have had children who responded negatively to tests, Zeng said. It is therefore not clear whether the virus can be transmitted in the uterus.\nOn the edge of the most heavily affected Chinese city of Wuhan, construction workers have now completed the second fastest-built hospital. In both hospitals, 2.500 beds are available for Corona patients. Patients with mild symptoms were transferred to temporary hospital camps in sports arenas, exhibition halls and other public places.\nThere was a 13-year-old in Germany the day before. Fall. Eleven of them are related to the Bavarian company Webasto, where employees had contracted infection from a colleague from China. Two returnees from China were also tested positively. The most recent viral findings came from the 38-year-old wife of one of the patients from Bavaria, as reported by the Bavarian Ministry of Health. Two of the couple's children were also infected. In the third child, a baby, the virus has not yet been detected.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "With the continuing rise in the number of cases of new lung disease in China, concern is growing worldwide. In Germany, for the first time, an infection with the dangerous lung disease has been confirmed. In this country, where further suspicions have become known, as in Bremen and Bremerhaven, consequences are being taken.\nThe Federal Government is considering leaving China voluntarily. A possible evacuation will be considered, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas (SPD) said on Monday in Berlin. The Foreign Office therefore assumes a two-digit number of Germans in the region concerned. The crisis staff met this morning to discuss further action.\nOther countries, such as France and the United States, have already initiated such recovery operations. The embassy is in contact with the Germans on the ground, it was said by Maas. \"We are testing and preparing for all options.\" He also advised against travelling to China. \"Travellers should consider not postponing or refraining from compulsory travel to China.\"\nSeveral German tour operators also face consequences: customers who have booked a trip to China can reschedule or cancel upcoming trips. Thus, Tui customers who wanted to travel to China in the next two weeks can change their travel dates free of charge. Currently, Tui has few guests in the country. \"We are in contact with the authorities and are monitoring the situation closely,\" said a speaker.\nTHE TOURISM offers free cancellations and rescheduling for Chinese trips with departure dates up to 31. March on. Currently, there are almost three digits of guests in the country. They would be kept up to date with SMS and hang-ups in the hotels, explained THE Tourist Board. The situation was closely monitored. Guests of the FTI Group may, according to the organiser Trips with departure date up to and including 21\nYeah. Reverse or cancel February free of charge.\nStudiosus said meanwhile travel to the country up to including 15. April. \"In view of the continuing deterioration of the situation and the tightening of the travel instructions of the Foreign Office, we do not currently see any possibility of carrying out planned Chinese tours,\" the provider announced on his homepage. Rapid relaxation is not expected. There is currently no travel warning for China.\nChina is rather a small market for German organisers. The German Travel Association (DRV) pointed out that every year, about 600'82010;000 to 650'8201000, German citizens travel to the country. About two thirds of them are business travellers.\nGuests from China are of greater importance for German tourism. According to recent data 2018, about three million overnight stays were counted by Chinese travellers in hotels, pensions and other accommodation between Rugen and Garmisch-Partenkirchen. They thus occupied twelve in the ranking of foreign vacationers. The main travel season is the summer months. \"The high spending behaviour of the Chinese with a turnover of six billion Euro 2018 reflects the economic importance for retailers and tourism and leisure industries in the travel country of Germany,\" said Petra Hedorfer, Chairman of the Board of the German Centre for Tourism (DZT). According to DZT Munich, Frankfurt, Berlin and Cologne, the popularity scale is very high.\nFear of the consequences of the virus depressed the mood in the stock markets on Monday. The Dax yielded directly to the start of trade 1,5 percent. In Japan, the Nikkei had to endure with more than two percent the strongest minus for six months, and the Dow Jones also gave in. Stock exchanges in China are closed due to the New Year celebration until Thursday. Tourism values such as Lufthansa and luxury goods manufacturers were particularly under pressure\nYeah.\nGiven the importance of the People's Republic for the world economy, there is growing concern that a weakening of local economic power could have far-reaching consequences for other countries as well. The usual crisis reactions can already be seen: supposedly safe and virus-independent equipment such as gold, Swiss francs or bitcoin gained value on Monday.\nDecember 2019: First infections become known. They are to go back to a market in the capital of Wuhan, where fish and wild animals are sold.\n31. December: 27 Patients are identified, the health authority in Wuhan informs.\nSix.

As reported by the Chinese health authority, the total number of deaths by 38 increased to now 170.\nThe number of confirmed patients increased to 7711 cases in China. After Tibet also reported the first disease with the new Coronavirus, infections have now been detected in all regions and provinces of China. The first cases occurred at the end of December in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.\nFrance also reported another infection. The fifth disease in the country is now the daughter of an 80-year-old Chinese tourist who is also ill, the French Ministry of Health reported. The condition of the 80-year-old was serious, the man continued to be treated in a Paris hospital. In addition, the condition of another infected 30-year-old who has been treated since the end of last week has worsened. Currently, around 50-year-old infections with the corona virus have been confirmed outside China.\nThe first four patients in Germany were, according to the Chief Medical Officer Clemens Wendtner of the Munich clinic Schwabing, symptomless and in good clinical condition on Wednesday.\nMany states, including Germany, continue to work to get their citizens out of the particularly affected city of Wuhan in Central China. In Japan the second charter machine with 210 compatriots from Wuhan returned on Thursday. The day before, 206 Japanese had already been detained. According to previous findings, none of them have so far been positive for the new agent. The United States had also flown out on Wednesday around 200.\nWhen exactly does a Federal Army plane start to pick up Germans from Wuhan, it was still unclear on Thursday\nYeah. No infections or suspected cases have been detected so far among the 90-German and family members living in the region around the capital of Wuhan. The Federal Army's plane is to land in Frankfurt. The passengers are to be quarantined there first. According to the Federal Ministry of Health, in consultation with the Hessian authorities, it was decided to place returnees centrally during the 14-day incubation period.\nThe head of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and Emergency Chief Michael Ryan showed concern on Wednesday about the \"rapid spread\" of lung disease. However, they were very impressed by the Chinese activities.\n\"The Chinese behavior during the Sars outbreak and the Chinese behavior today\"absolutely no comparison,\"said Ryan, who was already involved during the Sars outbreak 2003. The fact that so far there have only been a few dozen cases abroad is due to the stringent measures taken by China.\nOn the question of whether the WHO recommends the departure of foreigners, Tedros said: \"The decision is, of course, up to each country itself. But they must be well prepared if the virus is to be introduced in this way.\"\nIn view of the rapid spread of the new Coronavirus, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has again convened the Emergency Committee for Thursday.\nAfter British Airways and Lufthansa, more and more airlines are cancelling their flights to China. The Spanish airline Iberia will also cancel all connections to and from China as of Friday. The airline normally offers three flights a week between Madrid and Shanghai.\nChina's CFA football association announced on Thursday that it would postpone the country's football season for the time being. This is to protect the health of fans and players. A new start date was not mentioned at first\nYeah.\nAccording to the US Federal Reserve, Chinese economic growth is expected to be somewhat lower due to the new Coronavirus. It was too early to predict the effects accurately, but a \"certain disruption\" of economic life in the short term was very likely, said Federal Reserve Chief Jerome Powell on Wednesday before journalists. Weaker growth in China, the second largest economy in the world, would also be noticeable in the US, but only very limited, Powell said. Current knowledge suggests that China and its neighbours would be particularly affected. (dpa)\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Drugmakers racing to find a vaccine or effective treatment for the deadly new coronavirus in China cautioned that they have a long way to go.  \n That runs counter to reports of a supposed \"breakthrough\" that on Wednesday boosted financial markets and spurred optimism not necessarily backed by reality.  \n At least a dozen drugmakers are working on vaccines or antivirals and other treatments to help those infected with the fast-spreading contagion.  \n Investment costs for vaccines could run as high as $800 million in a process that, even if accelerated, will likely take more than a year until approval, according to executives from companies involved in the effort.  \n \"It will take at least 12 to 18 months, which means in the acute situation we are in now - at least in China - that will not create a benefit,\" said Thomas Breuer, chief medical officer of GlaxoSmithKline's <GSK.L> vaccine unit. GSK is working with developers by providing a technology that could make their vaccines more potent.  \n The virus, which emerged in December in China, has killed nearly 500 people and shows no sign of abating, with thousands of new cases reported each day, mostly in central China's Hubei province. But its spread to some 27 countries and regions has caused global alarm.  \n To be sure, companies developing treatments for patients who are already sick may be able to get a drug approved faster than a vaccine that would be given to healthy people. Even so, logistical and regulatory challenges remain, according to two executives at Gilead Sciences Inc <GILD.O>, which is working on an experimental antiviral treatment.  \n \"There is a distinction there between a therapeutic and a vaccine. Having said that, I think it is true that this won't be super fast and it will involve us investing at risk right now,\" said Gilead Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey\n.  \n Clinical trials for treatments can be smaller and of shorter duration than for vaccines, Parsey acknowledged.  \n Challenges in making sure therapies are effective and then scaling up production still remain. Gilead has only a limited supply of its remdesivir, which will be tested against the coronavirus after previously failing in trials as a treatment for Ebola.  \n  \n 'LOOKING FOR A MAGIC BULLET'  \n Dr. Thomas Frieden, who was director of the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention during the also deadly MERS outbreak, said the benefit of antiviral treatments for such emergencies in the past has been modest.  \n What worked with MERS and SARS, for example, was better infection control in healthcare facilities, he said of two other types of coronaviruses that also caused global alarm.  \n \"It doesn't mean we shouldn't try, but we're often looking for a magic bullet and the bright shiny object. Sometimes we need to just have the basics,\" Frieden said.  \n A Chinese TV report on Wednesday said that a research team at Zhejiang University had found an effective drug for the virus, while researchers in the UK told Sky News separately they had made a \"significant breakthrough\" in finding a vaccine.  \n Reuters could not independently verify the reports, but several traders cited them for sharp upticks in global stock markets.  \n \"There are no known effective therapeutics against this 2019-nCoV,\" said World Health Organization spokesman Tarik Jasarevic, using the current designation for the new coronavirus, when asked about reports of \"drug breakthroughs.\"  \n Health officials in the United States and China have set ambitious goals for getting a vaccine to initial human testing within the next few months.  \n Newer vaccine platforms, such as one developed by Moderna Inc <MRNA.O>, allow scientists to create a potential vaccine in record time just based on knowing the genetic code of the novel coronavirus\n. With the genetic code in hand, scientists can start vaccine development without needing a sample of the virus.  \n Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is using Moderna's platform, said the agency is on the fastest pace ever to develop a vaccine candidate.  \n He hopes to have a vaccine available for initial safety testing within two and a half to three months from the time scientists determined the genetic sequence of the virus.  \n Novavax Inc <NVAX.O> research chief Gregory Glenn told Reuters his company has taken vaccines from discovery to clinical testing in 90 days and believes it could do something similar for the new coronavirus.  \n But to move vaccine candidates from the lab to widespread use in patients involves a number of hurdles, according to health experts and executives for drugmakers working on coronavirus vaccines and treatments.  \n In addition to scaling up manufacturing capacity and building distribution networks, there are regulatory hurdles such as conducting large clinical trials to make sure a vaccine not only confers immunity to the virus but is safe for use in the general population.  \n \"The earliest you could even know if it's going to work is a year,\" Fauci said.  \n Whether even a highly effective vaccine will prove profitable for companies is another big question.  \n \"The outbreak could be abating by the time a vaccine is deemed safe,\" Karen Andersen, who follows biotech companies for Morningstar, said in a research note.  \n The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has raised around $800 million from donors to aid in preventing pandemic diseases and has allocated some of those funds to biotechs, including Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc <INO.O>, Moderna Inc <MRNA.O> and CureVac, which are working on coronavirus vaccines.  \n \"We stepped into this with no economic expectation,\" said Paul Stoffels, Johnson & Johnson's <JNJ.N> chief scientific officer\n. \"We'll see whether in the end it gives a reward.\" REUTERS\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — Two more people with pneumonia who have travelled to Wuhan, China were warded here and isolated as a precautionary measure, bringing the tally of such cases to five. \n The Ministry of Health (MOH) cautioned on Friday (Jan 17) that Singapore is “likely to see more suspect cases that will need to be investigated”. \n In the latest reported cases, a 64-year-old man from China and a 61-year-old female Singapore resident were admitted to a hospital for further assessment and treatment after they arrived here from Wuhan. \n They are in stable condition, MOH said, adding that the two did not visit the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which is a large seafood and animal market that has been associated with the cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan. \n In an update on the case involving the first Singaporean who was warded on Thursday for pneumonia, the MOH said that epidemiological investigations, clinical assessment and laboratory test results showed that the 69-year-old man’s case is not linked to the pneumonia cluster in Wuhan. \n The patient has also tested negative for coronavirus. \n The virus behind the outbreak at Wuhan city in the Hubei province of China is said to be a new coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV, which belongs to a family of coronaviruses that cause illness in people and that circulate among animals. \n In rare instances, animal coronaviruses can evolve and infect people and then spread from human to human, as it was with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers). \n The health authorities in Wuhan have diagnosed 41 people with the coronavirus. \n Most of the patients in Wuhan have reportedly had some link to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, although some patients did not report visiting this market, suggesting that some limited person-to-person spread may be occurring, the World Health Organization said\n. \n So far, there have been two confirmed cases in Thailand and one in Japan. In China, two people who were infected and had underlying medical conditions have died. \n Countries in Asia are on alert as the Chinese New Year approaches, given that it is a peak period for people from China to travel. \n In Singapore, temperature screening measures have been put up at Changi Airport for inbound flights arriving from Wuhan and suspected cases will be referred to hospitals for further assessment.  \n MOH said that it will continue to monitor the situation closely. \n “As medical practitioners are on the lookout for cases with pneumonia who have recently returned from Wuhan, Singapore is likely to see more suspect cases that will need to be investigated for possible links to the Wuhan cluster,” it said. \n The ministry also urged the public to remain vigilant and to adopt good personal hygiene practices at all times. \n It added that travellers to Wuhan should monitor their health closely and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell, and also inform their doctor of their travel history. \n Investigations into the two latest cases here are ongoing. \n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE - Four more cases of the coronavirus infection were confirmed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Wednesday (Feb 5), including the youngest patient confirmed so far, a six-month-old baby who is the child of an infected couple. \n Of the new cases, three are linked to the cluster of local transmissions announced on Tuesday, and one is an imported case involving a Chinese tourist from China's Wuhan city. \n On Tuesday, MOH announced six confirmed cases of the coronavirus, with four women here infected who had not travelled to Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus outbreak. \n These four cases are linked to a group of 20 tourists from Guangxi, China, that visited health products shop Yong Thai Hang in Cavan Road in Lavender. With the cases announced on Wednesday, the number of cases linked to the tour group is now seven. \n MOH said the Chinese health authorities have confirmed that two travellers from the tour group have the coronavirus infection. \n It reiterated that there is no evidence of widespread community transmission in Singapore for now. \n Wednesday's announcement means that the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore is 28. \n All four new cases are in stable condition, while 22 cases confirmed earlier are stable or improving, and one case has been discharged, said MOH. \n The remaining case needs extra oxygen support, but is not in the intensive care unit. \n Outside China, Singapore has the second highest number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus. Japan has the most with 33 cases so far. \n The four new cases announced here on Wednesday include a father and son - a Singaporean man and his baby boy. His wife and their maid were earlier confirmed to be infected. The third new case is the Singaporean husband of an infected tour guide, while the fourth is a tourist from China\n. \n The father and son, as well as the husband of the tour guide, are among the seven confirmed cases linked to a tour group that visited the Yong Thai Hang shop. \n First case: The baby boy, who is Singaporean and six months old, is the son of a woman who works at Yong Thai Hang, which caters to Chinese tour groups. \n He is warded in an isolation room at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital. \n MOH said the baby was not in any infant care facility before he was hospitalised - he was cared for at home. \n His 28-year-old mother is a Singapore permanent resident who did not recently travel to China. On Tuesday, MOH confirmed that she and their foreign domestic helper, a 44-year-old Indonesian woman, were infected with the coronavirus. \n This was after Yong Thai Hang was visited by a tour group from Guangxi on Jan 23. The Singaporean tour guide of the group was later confirmed to be infected. \n Second case: The baby's father was also one of the confirmed cases announced on Wednesday with no recent travel history to China. \n The 45-year-old Singaporean man is warded in an isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). \n Third case: Another case confirmed on Wednesday linked to the Chinese tour group that visited the shop is the husband of the group's infected tour guide. \n The 40-year-old Singaporean man also had not travelled to China recently, and is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID. \n He developed a fever on Jan 24 and visited Hougang Polyclinic with his wife, a 32-year-old Singaporean woman, on Jan 30. He went to NCID on Monday. \n Before the man was admitted to hospital, he was at his home in Buangkok Green and worked at Diamond Industries Jewellery Company at Harbour Drive which was visited by the same tour group from Guangxi. \n The man also visited Pasir Panjang Hawker Centre and used public transport\n. \n MOH said that the risk of infection from transient contact, such as on public transport or in public places, is assessed to be low. \n Fourth case: The last confirmed case announced on Wednesday is a 42-year-old Chinese national who arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on Jan 21. \n She is the daughter of one of the earlier confirmed cases, a 73-year-old woman who is also a Chinese national. \n As the 42-year-old showed symptoms, she was taken by ambulance to NCID on the same day as her mother, immediately isolated, and is now warded in an isolation room at the centre. \n Regarding the tour group from Guangxi that visited the Yong Thai Hang shop, MOH said that the group was in Singapore from Jan 22 to 23, and also transited here for three hours on Jan 27 before leaving the country. \n The group also visited five other places here: Diamond Industries Jewellery Company in Harbour Drive; Meeting You Restaurant in Hamilton Road; Royal Dragon Restaurant in Havelock Road; T Galleria by DFS in Scotts Road; and D’Resort @ Downtown East in Pasir Ris. \n Almost 14 days have passed since the tourists visited these places, and MOH has communicated with 142 contacts. All of these contacts are well except for one who has been isolated as a suspected case. Test results for this person are pending. \n The ministry has also done contact tracing for the crew and passengers of the flight that left Singapore with the Chinese tour group on Jan 27. Five of them are still in Singapore and have been quarantined. \n The coronavirus, known as 2019-nCov, first emerged in Wuhan in December last year and has so far proven to be more infectious than 2003's severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). \n As of Wednesday, the outbreak has sickened more than 24,000 people and killed more than 490, with Hong Kong reporting its first death from the coronavirus on Tuesday, the second fatality outside mainland China. \n The deceased was a 39-year-old man with an underlying illness\n. He had taken the high-speed train from Hong Kong to Wuhan city in Hubei province on Jan 21, and from Changsha in Hunan province to Hong Kong on Jan 23. \n Most of the deaths from the virus occurred in central Hubei province. \n On Wednesday, three business travellers – a Malaysian and two South Koreans – linked to a conference at the Grand Hyatt Singapore they attended last month, were reported to have tested positive for the coronavirus. \n The two South Korean men had come into contact with the Malaysian, who was infected. Details on how, where and when the Malaysian man became infected were not revealed by MOH. \n The ministry said that this private business meeting at the hotel from Jan 20 to 22 involved 109 people from the same company. \n Of the 15 Singapore residents at this event, 11 are well. Four have reported symptoms and were referred to NCID for assessment. \n The event’s remaining 94 overseas participants have since left Singapore and MOH has informed the relevant health authorities abroad. \n In the wake of the outbreak, a growing number of countries, including Italy, the United States, Australia, Singapore, Japan and Russia, have put in place travel restrictions. Germany, France and the US have evacuated citizens from China. \n Several major airlines have also halted flights to and from China, deepening concerns of a widespread economic slowdown. \n In Singapore, measures to combat the outbreak include mask distribution at residents' committee centres and community centres islandwide, which began last Saturday. \n The Government announced on Jan 30 that all 1.3 million households in Singapore would be given a pack of four masks each amid reports of shops running out of stock. \n On Tuesday, it also said that large gatherings and communal activities, such as assemblies and excursions, will be suspended at schools, pre-schools and eldercare facilities here from Wednesday, after the first local transmissions of the coronavirus were reported\n. \n MOH said on Wednesday that 295 suspected cases have tested negative for the virus so far. Test results for 62 more cases are pending. \n The ministry has identified 379 close contacts of the confirmed cases. Of these, 304 are still in Singapore, with 299 contacted and being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are being made to contact the remaining five close contacts. \n MOH continues to advise Singaporeans to defer all travel to Hubei province and all non-essential travel to mainland China. \n Members of the public should also observe good personal hygiene such as frequently washing their hands with soap. \n They should also wear a mask if they have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath, and seek medical attention promptly if they are feeling unwell. \n CLICK TO LISTEN TO ST'S HEALTH CHECK PODCAST\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE - Singapore has recorded its first cases of local coronavirus transmission, with four women here infected who had not travelled to Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. \n Two work at Yong Thai Hang, a Chinese health products shop in Cavan Road, in Lavender, that caters to Chinese tour groups. \n The third is a maid of one of the women, while the fourth is a tour guide who had taken groups to the same shop. \n The tour group in question has since returned to China. \n In addition, another two confirmed cases were announced on Tuesday (Feb 4). \n The two were among a group of 92 people flown back to Singapore from Wuhan on a Scoot flight last Thursday. Before this, another two on the same flight had been reported as confirmed cases. \n In total, there are now 24 confirmed cases in Singapore. \n Four of the new cases constitute \"limited local transmission\", the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Tuesday. \n \"There is, however, no evidence of widespread community transmission,\" said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong at a press conference. \n \"Despite our best efforts, Singapore could still see extensive community spread,\" he told reporters. \n Should that happen, Singapore will consider additional measures to reduce human-to-human interactions - such as cancelling mass gatherings, suspending schools, and paring down non-essential care services - to slow the spread of disease. \n The country has been preparing for such clusters, and measures implemented so far have been directed towards preventing and containing the risk of spread beyond such local clusters to the broader community, MOH said. \n As surveillance has been stepped up, more such local clusters are expected, including more cases of local transmission, it added. \n The ministry has also started contact tracing to ring-fence the cluster and limit further spread\n. \n Cases with limited community transmission are not unexpected, said Mr Gan, who co-chairs a multi-ministry task force to defend the country against the virus. \n \"This is a scenario which we are prepared for,\" he said, noting that efforts will help reduce the risk of escalation. \n \"As the situation evolves, we will step up our posture accordingly to further contain the situation in Singapore.\" \n With local transmission happening here, the Government is stepping up cleaning of public areas, as well as measures to lower the risk for vulnerable groups such as young children and the elderly. \n To keep students safe, for instance, schools will implement staggered recess times, and stop activities such as mass assemblies and school camps. Eldercare facilities will also suspend excursions and large-scale gatherings. \n As an added precaution, the authorities said they are also contacting people with similar profiles to the four cases of local transmission, who have had recent close contact with individuals with travel history to China. \n In addition, all patients with pneumonia at public hospitals have been tested for the 2019-nCoV, as the virus is called, since last week. \n Current evidence suggests that the virus can be spread by droplets from infected individuals, and the best way to prevent this is through personal hygiene and social responsibility. Businesses and organisations are also advised to clean their premises more often, especially high-traffic areas. \n The earlier 18 confirmed cases of the virus here were all imported, comprising 16 Chinese nationals and two Singaporeans who had all travelled recently to Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province. \n One has been discharged, said the ministry on Tuesday. \n MOH also said that as of Tuesday, 12pm,  289 of the suspected cases have tested negative for the coronavirus. The test results for 20 more cases are pending. \n The ministry has identified 311 close contacts of the confirmed cases as well\n. Of these,  239 are still in Singapore, with 234 contacted and being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are being made to contact the remaining five close contacts. \n The ministry said that once a confirmed case of the virus is identified, it will closely monitor all close contacts. As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient. \n All other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and contacted daily to monitor their health status. \n (From left) Director of medical services at the Ministry of Health Kenneth Mak, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong; Permanent Secretary for Manpower Aubeck Kam; and director of schools at the Ministry of Education Liew Wei Li at a press conference on Feb 4, 2020. ST PHOTO: KUA CHEE SIONG \n The updates were given after a two-day lull on Sunday and Monday, when no new cases were reported. \n The coronavirus outbreak shows no signs of abating, and while Singapore has put in place multiple lines of defence to check cases coming in from abroad or being passed within the community, it must prepare for a long fight against the virus, Mr Gan had told Parliament on Monday. \n The coronavirus was first reported in Wuhan late last year. As of Monday, it had infected more than 20,000 people and claimed over 420 lives, mainly in China. \n Outside mainland China, there have been close to 300 cases and two deaths, one each in Hong Kong and the Philippines. \n Global authorities have warned of more person-to-person spread, with the United States, Thailand, South Korea and Hong Kong all reporting local transmission. \n On Tuesday, Malaysian health authorities also confirmed the first citizen to be infected with the coronavirus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 10. They said the 41-year-old Malaysian had travelled to Singapore for a meeting last month with colleagues from China - including one from Wuhan\n. But he showed symptoms only on Jan 29, nearly a week after he returned to Malaysia. \n Chinese data suggests that the coronavirus, while much more contagious than Sars, is significantly less lethal, although such numbers can evolve rapidly. It very likely passed from certain wild animals to humans at Wuhan's South China Seafood Market and then evolved into human-to-human transmission. \n Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei and all non-essential travel to China, while visitors with recent travel to China will not be allowed entry here. \n - The 19th case is a 28-year-old Singapore permanent resident, a woman who had no recent travel history to China. She works as a sales staff member at health product shop Yong Thai Hang at 24, Cavan Road, in Lavender, that primarily served Chinese tourists. \n She developed a sore throat and fever on Jan 29 and was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) last Thursday, but was discharged from hospital after her chest X-Ray result came back negative for pneumonia. \n She did not leave her home in Jalan Bukit Merah from Friday to Sunday and was admitted to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) on Monday. \n - The 20th case is a 48-year-old Singaporean, a woman who also had no recent travel history to China. She lived in Hougang Street 61 and also worked at Yong Thai Hang. \n She reported symptoms on Jan 25 and was admitted to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Monday. \n - The 21st case is a 44-year-old Indonesian woman who also had no recent travel history to China. She is the domestic helper of case 19, and stayed with her employer in her home in Jalan Bukit Merah. She reported symptoms on Sunday and had not left her home since then. \n She was admitted to SGH on Monday. \n - The 22nd and 23rd cases are Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30. They did not have symptoms when they boarded the flight and were quarantined when they landed in Singapore\n. \n The two cases tested positive for the coronavirus on Monday even though they still showed no symptoms. \n They are now warded in isolation rooms at NCID. \n All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were, as an added precaution, were tested for the coronavirus. \n - Case 24 is a 32-year-old Singaporean who had no recent travel history in China. \n She is a tour guide who took groups to Yong Thai Hang, the same shop where cases 19 and 20 worked. \n The tour guide did not show any symptoms when she went to NCID on Monday. She was immediately isolated and is now warded in an isolation room in the centre. \n She tested positive for the virus on Tuesday afternoon. \n One of the confirmed cases, case seven, a 35-year-old Wuhan resident, has recovered and tested negative for the virus. He was discharged from NCID on Tuesday. \n Additional reporting by Rei Kurohi and Timothy Goh \n LISTEN TO ST'S HEALTH CHECK PODCAST\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "LONDON - Scientists and public health officials are beginning to get a better understanding of the coronavirus that has spread rapidly in China and increasingly around the world. \n But significant gaps remain. \n Important findings have emerged from scrutinising early cases of the novel coronavirus from China as health officials race to slow the spread of the pneumonia-like disease, which has infected more than 2,000 people, most of them in China. \n The first clinical data published on the lethal Sars-like virus suggest it has a stealthy quality in its early stages that could allow it to evade detection, Bloomberg reported. \n Two studies published on Friday (Jan 24) in The Lancet medical journal depict \"a disease with a three to six day incubation period and insidious onset\" with fever, cough and muscle pain, Dr David Heymann, an infectious disease specialist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, wrote in a commentary in the journal. \n Some patients have mild disease, but older patients, aged over 60, progress to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and need intensive care. \n He said the two studies provided valuable early insight on the virus because they confirm that many patients had contact with the seafood market that is the suspected source of infection, while others did not but had contact with patients in their family cluster or elsewhere. \n \"Although these reports confirm person-to-person transmission, the means of transmission and the transmissibility cannot be hypothesised from the information published,\" he said. \n According to The Guardian, researchers said they need to quickly find out whether most cases have been caused by repeated spillover of the virus from animals into humans, or whether most cases are now being triggered by secondary human-to-human transmission\n. \n \"That would be the big epidemiological goal for everyone at the moment,\" Dr Trevor Bedford, an evolutionary geneticist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington, told the journal Nature. \n Genetic analysis of various strains of the new virus, called 2019-nCoV, detected in patients shows the strains are remarkably similar to each other. \n This lack of genetic diversity suggests the common ancestor of these different strains only emerged recently, possibly in November or December, said The Guardian. \n However, research does not yet say whether the recent rapid expansion of the virus took place in humans or in an animal reservoir. \n The new virus is most closely related to coronaviruses that have been found in Chinese horseshoe bats, according to the report. \n Other coronaviruses that have jumped to humans, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), have been linked to bats. \n While the World Health Organisation stopped short of calling the new virus a global health emergency, the number of deaths has risen to 56 and the number of confirmed infections is rising quickly. \n The first cases of the new virus emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan, centring on a large seafood market. \n In the first of the two case studies published in The Lancet, initial data from that city show some similar symptoms between the first 41 cases of the virus and Sars. \n About one-third of the 41 patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome or were admitted to intensive care, and six died, according to the study. \n The median age of the 41 patients was 49. Two-thirds had been to the seafood market that also sold wild animals for meat and is thought to be the place the virus jumped from an animal source to people. \n All had pneumonia, most had fever and a cough. Some had fatigue; rarer symptoms included headache and diarrhoea. Most had been healthy until they contracted the virus\n. \n Despite similar symptoms to Sars such as fever and shortness of breath, there are also key differences, including the absence of upper respiratory tract symptoms and intestinal sickness, according to Bin Cao, lead author from the China-Japan Friendship Hospital and Capital Medical University in China. \n The second study published in the Lancet focused on person-to-person transmission and inter-city spread of the virus in a family in China. \n Six members of the family travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29 last year and Jan 4. \n \"Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus. \n \"Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members,\" according to the study. \n The patients arrived at the University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital in Shenzhen six to 10 days after the onset of their symptoms, wrote Dr Jasper Fuk-Woo Chan, from the hospital's Department of Clinical Microbiology and Infection Control, in the study which was co-authored by more than a dozen other colleagues. \n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had been to a Wuhan hospital to visit sick relatives, the authors said. \n Five family members, aged between 36 and 66, developed fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these three to six days after exposure, the study said. \n On Sunday, China's National Health Commission Minister Ma Xiaowei told reporters that the authorities' knowledge of the new virus was limited and they are unclear on the risks posed by mutations of the virus. \n He said the incubation period for the coronavirus can range from one to 14 days, and that the virus is infectious during incubation. \n This was not the case with Sars, which originated in China and killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003\n. \n A clinical trial is underway using anti-HIV drugs Ritonavir and Lopinavir to treat patients infected with the new virus, according to a separate article published in The Lancet on Friday. \n Beijing's municipal health commission said on Sunday the drugs made by AbbVie Inc are part of the National Health Commission's latest treatment plan, and its hospitals have supplies of the medicine if needed.\n",

Oil prices jumped on the reports. \n Asked about the reports, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said: “There are no known effective therapeutics against this 2019-nCoV (virus) and the WHO recommends enrolment into a randomized controlled trial to test efficacy and safety.”  \n The process of developing and testing drugs or vaccines against a new pathogen normally takes many years and is often fraught with pitfalls and failures. \n Even at the accelerated pace enabled by new technologies, the earliest that scientists hope to be able to start initial human trials of a new coronavirus vaccine is by June this year. \n Doctors looking for ways to treat patients infected with the new coronavirus are likely to try antiviral medicines licensed for use against other viral infections to see if they might help, as well as potential antiviral drugs still in development. \n The US drugmaker Gilead says it has started clinical trials of patients in China infected with the new coronavirus, using an experimental drug called remdesivir, but stressed that this work is investigational at this stage. \n “It is not approved anywhere globally,” a Gilead spokesman told Reuters in Beijing. \n Gilead said it had increased manufacturing of remdesivir to create a stockpile that might be used in future viral disease outbreaks.  \n “We are doing this before knowing whether the drug is safe and effective to treat 2019-nCoV,” the spokesman said.\n",

But the company, alarmed, reminds users that the game is not for collecting information and forwards it to the World Health Organisation (WHO) website, says El Mundo.\nCreating an epidemic, virus mutations, admiring the virtues and relentless way in which it spreads and basically building panic in society, aiming at eliminating the world's population, are the outlines of the game created by Ndemic Creations, which has reached over 120 million customers in the last eight years.\nThe coronavirus originated in Wuhan in recent weeks and has already killed at least ten people, infecting other 4500, confirmed the Chinese authorities this Tuesday.\nEvery time something like this happens, the game goes viral and attracts a lot of people. That is exactly what the company explained on Friday when, on the official social media pages of the game, it reported that the site was down because there were too many online players. And he wrote, in a statement, that there are those who download the game to gather information and understand the complexities of the outbreaks.\n\"We designed the game specifically to be realistic and informative,\" says the company, noting that \"it is a game, not a scientific model\", advising stakeholders to seek information at appropriate locations such as the WHO.\n\"Can you contaminate the world? \"Thus begins the description of the game.

In Germany, Spain, France and the United Kingdom, the measure is planned, if necessary for 14 days, to incubate the disease until the first symptoms appear.\nIn Spain, for example, El Pais has already advanced that quarantine will be carried out at the Ulla Central Hospital in Madrid, where a full floor is reserved. In the UK, Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, has already warned: \"Public safety is our priority. Those who return from Wuhan will be isolated for four days with all necessary medical care.\"\nAlthough there is no provision for the quarantine to be compulsory, the Health Minister stated this Thursday that the Portuguese to be removed from China will be screened before they start their journey and arrive at the airport. Marta Temido added that Portugal still studies the hypothesis of a containment space, \"whether at home or elsewhere\", which depends on the \"clinical condition of these people and their previous history\".\nThe contingency plan that is set up in three Portuguese hospitals entails personal protective equipment, spaces and means allocated and linkage with INEM for the reception of any contaminated persons, found the Express at the health units.\nIn view of the spread of the epidemic, it was last week that the Directorate-General for Health designated the hospitals of San Juan in Porto, and the Curry Cabral and Stephania in Lisbon as destinations for potential infected people. The responsibility of hospitals only comes with the arrival of patients in the hospital unit\nYeah.\n\"The transport of these patients (suspected or confirmed cases) should be done by INEM, which has the appropriate means,\" explains St John's Hospital. source of the same unit clarifies that \"acute disease situations\" will only be addressed and that hospitals are not expected to be a place designated for quarantine of possible patients.\n\"Only patients will be admitted to the institution of the University Hospital Centre of San Juan; we have no information that the repatriation of any Portuguese citizen who is ill is expected\", they say.\nFrom Curry Cabral in Lisbon, the information is the same. To the Express, Fernando Maltez, Director of the Infectious Diseases Service, reinforces that the contingency plan already drawn up will be applied only to infected or suspected infected people. This plan \"contemplates the isolation of these people in their own rooms in the service of infectious diseases\". In this sense, \"14 negative pressure respiratory isolations\" were made available, used to house patients with infectious diseases.\nBut as the contingency plan was \"prepared to ensure the safety of both patients and health professionals\", other measures are foreseen, such as the existence of separate \"passing circuits\" and the delivery of \"individual protective equipment\", such as \"coats, gloves, masks, glasses and hats\". Everything is in place, including with regard to the'therapeutic and diagnostic methods to be implemented', says Fernando Maltez.\nIn the case of St. John's Hospital in Oporto, the prevention plan, which will be updated \"according to the knowledge of the evolution of the epidemic\", includes specific \"physical spaces and means\" that are allocated to this response. This includes physicians, whose number depends on the amount of \"suspected or confirmed cases\" being forwarded and their characteristics, in particular whether adults or children and degree of severity.\"\nYeah.\nAs with Curry Cabral Hospital, the healthcare professionals at the hospital in Porto who provide care for these patients will have to use \"personal protective equipment appropriate to the type and risk of transmission of this agent\", which, depending on the activity to be carried out, will go through the use of \"masks, gowns, gloves and eye protection (glasses or visors).\nAlthough the plan is specific, because it is a new virus and therefore has \"its own characteristics\", St John's Hospital admits that there are points of contact with previous diseases, such as bird flu or influenza A. \"There are naturally similarities to previous emerging diseases in the way they are transmitted, as has been done. the evolution of the epidemic and the implications in terms of public health and control measures,\"they admit.\nFernando Maltez adds that the Curry Cabral has already \"activated several contingency plans for other infectious disease threats\" and that these plans \"are being modified and updated\" with changes in personal protective equipment, as with the e bola outbreak that originated in the Democratic Republic of Congo, \"which is transmitted by contact with any organic fluid\" and not \"respiratory only\", as in the case of coronavirus.\nWith regard to the precautions to be taken, the specialist says that they are the same as in a case of influenza, including for those living with the Portuguese who are to be taken shortly from Wuhan, all indications are that this Friday already, and placed under surveillance at home for a 14-day period, on a case-by-case basis.\n\"These citizens do not need to stay home alone, and can live with family and friends as long as they wear a mask and wash their hands.

The schools have postponed its reopening until further notice.\nThe Chinese Prime Minister, Li Keqiang, visited Wuhan this Monday to verify ongoing efforts to contain the epidemic, having spoken with patients and medical staff, added the government.\nCases have been confirmed in the special administrative regions of Macao and Hong Kong, where the commemorative sites of the Lunar New Year have given way to quarantine centres.

The \"lack of transparency\" makes it \"very difficult\" for the leadership in Beijing \"to assess the reality of any threat and react quickly\", he summarized.\nThe trade war with Washington and the protests that have been raging for months in Hong Kong have been neglected by the central government as a result of \"rigidity and inability to understand the global scenario\", while swine fever and the new coronavirus reflect \"structural failures\" in food production, he added. who in 1988 started doing research at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\n",

It is considered the largest act of political propaganda in the People's Republic of China.\nThe images of the country's founding father, the historic leader of the Chinese Communist Party, the founder of Maoism, ran worldwide. Mao Tse-Tung had his summer residence in Wuham, the capital of Hunan province where he was born, in the poor village of Shaoshan, four hundred kilometres away, where even today the leader is idolized.\nThe occasion is celebrated every year, thousands of Mao worshipers enter Yangt se, but the city that bathes is no longer the same, has become the mecca of capitalism to China, torn by skyscrapers, populated by western chain stores of clothing, fast food, attended by thousands of students at one of the largest Chinese universities and cradle of production units of the major brands of the car industry, which earned her the comparison with Detroit before the decline of the American city.\nThousands of migrants live there working in the large units of General Motors, Honda, Nissan, PSA and Renault, as well as in Chinese Dongfeng (PSA partner and shareholder) and SAIC (GM partner) which employs six thousand people.\nBut it was in the traditional unhealthy market ruckus that was to be closed last year and that sells fish, shellfish and birds, but also exotic animals for human consumption from hedgehogs to live crocodiles that were identified between space salesmen and visitors with pneumonia symptoms, then reported to the Organization World Health Organization on the last day of last year\nYeah.\nA week later, already in 2020, a new Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified, which quarantined the city and spread the alarm throughout Mao's cradle province, infecting the rest of the world, first with the cutting of several international air links to prevent the virus from travelling. Still, a few days after the alarm there were more than six thousand cases in all of central China, hundreds and a half of deaths, and the record of cases in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and other Asian countries, but also in Australia, the United States, South America and Europe.\n15 million people were expected to pass through Wuham during the minivacation period of the Chinese New Year- perhaps many could have gone a few miles north to the Panlongcheng archaeological site, which dates from the Shang dynasty, between 1600 and 1046 a.C. The expenses of entertainment and transportation, according to S&P Global, They should drop ten percent because of the Coronavirus.\nHistorical city\nWuhan has more inhabitants than Portugal. Nearly 11 million people live there, despite everything that is not expressive to Chinese standards: it is only the seventh most populous city in China when classified by urban population.\nBut Wuhan is of vital importance in the economic health of the country, located at the confluence of the Yangtze River and its largest tributary, the Han River, with a hundred kilometres extension, is an important communication and distribution centre for the whole of central China and also for the main economic partners. There follow the inland, air and rail transport networks which are involved in the growth of the second largest economy in the world.\nYeah.\nThe economic, political and commercial centre of the region is often called the \"Chinese Way\" and economists predict that the impact on the Chinese Gross Domestic Product of the partial quarantine imposed by the Coronavirus is at least one per cent. If the emergency does not go far beyond the commemorations of the Chinese New Year, last January's 25th, whose traditional holiday was celebrated this year in protective masks on the face or at home, as the authorities have imposed.\nIn 2019, the growth of Wuhan's GDP was 7,8 per cent, 1,7 percentage points above the national average. The total import and export value reached 244 billion yuans (about 40 billion euro), a record that was 13,7 per cent above the previous year and represented 61,9 percent of the total value of foreign trade in the province.\nMore than 300 of the 500 largest companies in the world are present in the city, including Microsoft. In recent years, Wuhan has invested to become a high-tech center, especially for the optical industry. Yet its reputation as the'car city'of China has never waned, its impact as a major logistical centre has a major influence on the economic health of China, which came to be briefly and on two occasions the capital in 1927 and again during the terrible Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937.\nBut by the 1911 Wuham had marked the history of that great country, when it was the stage of the Wuchang uprising, which overthrew the last imperial dynasty. Fifteen years later, the troops led by Chiang Kai-shek conquered the city, giving breath to control of the territory by the alliance between their Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist Party, which already comprised the entire southeast of the country.\nBut Wuhan was also a symbol of the division between the KMT and the Communists.\nYeah. The war with Japan, which invaded China as part of its expansionist plans even before World War II, put an end to Chiang Kai-shek's attempts to unify the country. Before the Japanese advance, the KMT government was forced to abandon the capital, Nanjing, retreating to Wuhan and then to the remote town of Chongqing.\nIn July of 1967, at the height of the Cultural Revolution, there was a so-called Wuhan incident: an armed conflict between two groups fighting for control of the city. The two opposing forces were the \"Million Heroes\" and the \"General Headquarters of the Wuhan Workers\".\nThe first included 500 thousand people, mainly skilled workers, civil servants and the party, and was supported by the commander of Wuhan Military Region, General Chen Zaidao. The General Headquarters, with many other supporters, was composed of workers and students from the Red Guard. They engaged in a propaganda war to gain support from the local community -Mao was president of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and had already swam in the waters of Yangth.\nTwelve days later, the 28 of July 1966, representatives of the Red Guard wrote to Mao, claiming rebellion and rebellion to carry out the Cultural Revolution. Many people accused of being counter-revolutionary were forced to commit suicide.\nDuring 1966's'red August', 1772 were killed only in Beijing. In Shanghai, there were 704 suicides and 534 deaths related to the Cultural Revolution in September. In Wuhan there were 62 suicides and 32 murders.

It is also not yet clear the form of transmission between humans, the exact period in which this transmission takes place and the rate of attack of the virus. That is, know the epidemiology of the new infection -Who, How and When?\nHere are some questions about the virus for which there is no answer:\nWhat's the real rate of attack? Although the number of infected daily increases, it is still not really known what the reach of the virus is.\nWho are the most affected people?\nIt is not known whether the virus also affects all types of people, from adults or children, sick or healthy, as pointed out to the agency Lusa the pneumologist Filipe Froes, appointed representative of the Medical Association for issues related to the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\nThe international authorities do not yet know who has the most serious forms of the disease and what the characteristics of those killed by this new virus are.\nPneuologist Filipe Froes recalls that no serious situation has yet occurred outside China, although all cases of the disease are imported.\nDoes the virus affect children? And what's your expression in paediatric age? W\nThere is a case report of a nine-month-old baby infected by one parent, but it is not yet known whether the virus has affected children in the same way as it affects adults.\nWhat's the transmission period? W\nPneuologist Filipe Froes recalls that the Chinese authorities warned that there may be transmission between people even before the onset of symptoms\nYeah. It is not known whether it is an exception or a rule and how long before symptoms show up can the disease be contagious. It is also unknown whether, as in the case of SARS (English acronym for Acute Grave Respiratory Syndrome), there are patients with a higher contagious capacity than others.\nIt is also unknown what the longest period of transmission and even when it occurs.\nWhat treatments are there? W\nPatients are currently being treated with supportive measures that only treat the symptoms of the disease, such as fever or respiratory distress. There is still no specific medicine for this new coronavirus.\nFilipe Froes indicates that there will be experimental treatments under way, but it is still unknown how effective they will be.\nAccording to the expert, a vaccine will already be in development, based largely on the work that had been done for atypical pneumonia of 2002/2003-SARS. It is also necessary to wait for tests on effectiveness and safety.\nWhat is the exact origin of the virus? W\nThe first cases of the new human coronavirus were linked to a fish and meat market in the Chinese town of Wuhan. However, it is not known which animal transmitted the virus to the first infected patient, nor whether an animal is the original host and another intermediate host.\nSo what is known about the new coronavirus?\nCoronavirus is a large family of viruses living in other animals (e.g. birds, bats, small mammals) and which in humans usually cause respiratory diseases, from a common cold to more serious cases such a s pneumonias. They can be transmitted between animals and people. Most coronavirus strains circulate between animals and do not even infect humans. In fact, so far, only six strains of coronavirus among the existing thousands have crossed the species barrier and reached people\nYeah.\nThe new coronavirus is from the same family as the Grave Acute Respiratory Syndrome (2002-2003) virus and the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (2012).\nThese two types of coronavirus are so far those who have been able to cross the species barrier and to transmit themselves to humans and who have pictures of some gravity, explained to Lusa Agency pneumologist Filipe Froes.\nThe first cases of 2019-nCoV appeared in mid-December in the Chinese town of Whuan, when people with a viral pneumonia began to arrive at hospitals. It was found that all people were often working or visiting Huanan's seafood and meat market in the same city. The exact origin of the infection is still unknown, but it would have been infected animals, which are marketed alive, transmitting it to humans.\nThese viruses are usually transmitted via the airway and mainly affect the respiratory tract, especially the lungs in severe forms.\nSymptoms of these coronaviruses are more intense than flu and include fever, pain, general malaise and respiratory distress. In the initially confirmed cases, 90% showed fever, 80% dry cough, 20% shortness of breath and only about 15% presented difficulty.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE: Since the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak was declared on Dec 31, 2019, Indonesia’s Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Indonesia Country Office have been working in unison. \n They have also collaborated to strengthen response measures in anticipation of the coronavirus with the first public information release on Jan 8. \n INITIAL RESPONSE \n As the situation worsened in mid-Jan before the Lunar New Year holiday with the lockdown of specific cities in the Hubei province, Indonesian Minister of Health Terawan Agus Putranto announced that a budget had been allocated specifically to tackle the situation, ensuring that adequate training, logistics and standard operating procedures were provided or updated to anticipate the detection of positive cases. \n The ministry had also carried out webinars since Jan 24 to increase the awareness and detection of the 2019-nCoV across the public sectors including health agencies, laboratories, hospitals and environment agencies within local provincial government authorities. \n As part of containment efforts, the government had placed mobile containers designed to prevent containment on standby at major ports should they detect any passengers fitting the case definition and presenting with symptoms. These passengers will be transported in these containment units to pre-identified hospitals and treated appropriately. \n A public information portal has been established to provide daily updates on the situation. \n The public can also access information through their Facebook, Instagram and Twitter pages with the following hashtag: #WaspadaVirusCorona. \n The Ministry of Health, through the Bureau of Communication and Community Services and together with the Directorate of Health Promotion and Community Empowerment, has issued many risk communication materials and posters online and via media broadcasts. \n SCEPTICISM \n Buoyed by the confidence in his country’s preparations in handling the virus, Putranto declared on Jan 30 that \"all (steps) have been taken to make sure that there is no outbreak (in Indonesia).” \n According to the latest reports on Feb 1, there are no detected cases in Indonesia reported yet. \n Sentiments among Indonesians and on social media, however, suggest some scepticism about these bold claims. \n One reason for this disbelief is the close links between Indonesia and China. The world’s second-largest economy is a major investor in Indonesia, which happens to be Southeast Asia’s largest economy. In the first half of 2019, Chinese investments in Indonesia reached US$2.3 billion, making up for 16.2 per cent of total foreign investment in the country. \n  \n These close links also suggest a strong presence of Chinese citizens in Indonesia. According to Statistics Indonesia, from January to November 2019, Chinese tourists to Indonesia numbered 1.92 million, forming 12.87 per cent of all incoming tourists into the country. \n At the time of Putranto’s statement, there was no restriction on Chinese travelling into Indonesia. The presence of many Chinese tourists made his claim that there will be no outbreak in the country incredulous, since it is impossible to detect Chinese tourists with latent or asymptomatic infections. \n As an anticipatory measure, the Ministry of Health had already tightened screening at airports and ports, especially for passengers who came from China. \n Indonesian Director-General of Disease Prevention and Control Dr Anung Sugihantono had earlier announced on Jan 27 that the Ministry of Health had stepped up alertness early to check the body temperature of passengers arriving from China via plane or ship with a thermal scanner arriving through all ports. \n Such measures may have given authorities the confidence that there was no need to restrict travellers from China into the country. \n URGENT MEASURES \n However, with the WHO declaring the virus an international emergency last Friday (Jan 31), the ground has shifted beneath Indonesia. \n On the same day that WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus confirming that the global body had revised its risk assessment after crisis talks, in Indonesia more than 40,000 workers at a vast Chinese-controlled industrial complex in Sulawesi were quarantined in anticipation to reduce the risk of exposure to the community. \n That Friday, Indonesia also announced that it was preparing to evacuate nationals stranded in Wuhan with 238 people subsequently evacuated with four stating that they were comfortable with staying behind and three not being able to pass the screening to be fit to travel. \n The evacuated passengers, along with the flight crew, have been quarantined at a military facility on Natuna Besar Island, near the waters where the Indonesian navy had a standoff with Chinese vessels only last month over a territorial incursion incident. \n Although, on Feb 6, the authorities said they had yet to test those quarantined in Natuna for the virus as they are not showing any symptoms. The cost for carrying out tests can also be prohibitive, the health ministry noted. \n  \n On Feb 2, Indonesia also announced that it will temporarily stop flights to and from mainland China starting Wednesday (Feb 5) and bar visitors who have been in China for 14 days from entering or transiting in the country. \n Although there is no certainty that these efforts can stand up to the spread of an infectious disease, Indonesians should take comfort that its government is not ignoring the risks of an outbreak occurring. \n There is apprehension that detection may be lacking in Indonesia but the capabilities and capacity in the country’s health system are adequate to pick up any cases so there should be little reason to doubt their ability in this regard. \n \"Indonesia has a functioning early warning system and 100 hospitals in various locations that serve as referral (centres) and can handle cases with proper measures as well as effective infection prevention, WHO representative for Indonesia, Navaratnasamy Paranietharan, told Indonesian media last week. \n KEEP CALM \n In the larger scheme of things, the response measures carried out by Indonesia’s health ministry thus far is in line with the escalation recommendations as outlined in WHO’s online course for the 2019-nCoV. \n The WHO Country Office for Indonesia had supported the government on technical issues such as risk communication materials, clinical guidelines and response measures recommendations. \n Moreover, based on WHO’s report thus far, patients with the 2019-nCoV infection may present a wide range of symptoms. \n Most seem to have mild symptoms, with only 20 per cent progressing to a severe disease, including pneumonia, respiratory failure and in some cases death. \n There may be reports of asymptomatic persons being infectious and would likely fuel the spread of the disease. However, most of these cases thus far had presented only mild symptoms despite being detected with severe viral infection. \n Given the high human traffic volume and trade between these countries, the novel coronavirus is likely to present itself in Indonesia in the near future. But the government has taken all the necessary steps to give the country a fighting chance against the epidemic. \n Qing Yuan Pang served as an epidemiologist with the World Health Organization in Bangladesh and had previously spent time in Indonesia working on disaster monitoring and analysis for the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Affairs (AHA Centre) and was extensively involved in the emergency efforts for the Central Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami in 2018. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE: Like many others on the frontline during the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) pandemic in 2003, the resources of a family clinic in Choa Chu Kang had been stretched thin. \n Personal protective equipment - N95 respirators, sterile gloves and full-body gowns - was scarce at a time when the world had never seen a virus like it, and people everywhere were desperately scrambling to stockpile emergency supplies for themselves. \n Dr Tan Tze Lee, a general practitioner at the Edinburgh Clinic, recalled the difficulties that frontline healthcare workers faced when procuring equipment to protect themselves from the killer virus. \n By the time SARS was contained in May 2003, it had infected 238 people and killed 33 in Singapore. Two in five of those infected had been healthcare workers. \n While Dr Tan’s clinic thankfully encountered no cases, it remained on high alert for SARS patients in the four months of the epidemic in Singapore, throughout which the medical staff had to don full protective gear. But everyone was not ready for the crisis, said Dr Tan, who is also president of the College of Family Physicians Singapore. \n Many continued to work but were extremely concerned that they might bring the virus home and put their loved ones at risk, he added. \n “The healthcare practitioners in Singapore were ill-prepared, which resulted in sombre outcomes. Since then, we have learnt our lesson and measures were instituted to prepare us for any future pandemic event.” \n “Here we are today, ready to fight the 2019-nCoV,” he said. \n The current outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus - or 2019-nCoV, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) temporary name for the virus - was first confirmed in Singapore on Jan 23. To date, all cases were imported, including a Singaporean who was in Wuhan, and there has been no evidence of community spread in the Republic. \n The WHO has yet to declare the virus - which has spread to several countries - as a pandemic. Nevertheless, it was declared a global health emergency on Friday (Jan 31). \n The first cases were reported in Wuhan in China’s Hubei province and believed to be linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which sells live animals. \n At the heart of Singapore's response plan is the Disease Outbreak Response System (DORS), a crisis management plan which did not exist in 2003, but was drafted after SARS and refined again in the wake of the swine flu (or H1N1) pandemic in 2009. \n  \n “After SARS, we made a thorough review of the facilities we had – the infrastructure, hospitals, isolation wards, and the scientific testing and capabilities,” said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week. \n “I think we are much better prepared now.” \n Currently, Singapore is at DORS condition (DORSCON) Yellow, signifying that the virus is severe and can infect from person to person, but is chiefly occurring outside Singapore. The next step up is DORSCON Orange, which would have applied in the case of SARS, whereby the virus is spreading in Singapore but not widely, and is being contained. \n While the plans are in place and some measures have kicked in, Singapore’s national strategy is still largely untested - since the Wuhan coronavirus is believed to be in its early stages in the Republic, medical experts and SARS veterans said. \n However, there are ample signs that the lessons from SARS are being applied as Singapore shores up its defences, they said. They believe that unlike during SARS, Singapore is far more ready now. \n LESSONS LEARNT \n Singapore has had two brushes with pandemics in recent memory - SARS and H1N1. \n While Singapore was able to contain and recover from both, the varying nature of the viruses, as well as the changes in medical science, meant that dealing with each required different approaches. \n Doctors had limited options when treating SARS patients and could only administer supportive care, and there was nothing that could be done to prevent infection. In comparison, vaccines and treatment options were available when H1N1 claimed 18 lives in Singapore and infected more than 400,000 people, out of which about 1,300 had to be hospitalised. \n COMMAND AND CONTROL \n SARS first arrived in Singapore in late February 2003, and was detected in a woman with an atypical pneumonia on March 1, 2003 at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). At the time, no one knew how deadly and virulent it was and the first patient led to a cluster of 42 cases at the hospital. \n A Ministry of Health (MOH) taskforce was set up on Mar 15, two weeks after the mysterious strain appeared in Singapore and three days after the WHO issued a global alert on the outbreak that began in Hong Kong. \n But the command and control structure then was “wholly inadequate” in a crisis situation that was both fluid and unprecedented, a study in the Austrian Journal of South-east Asian Studies concluded in 2012. \n  \n The structure was led by the health authorities, when in hindsight, it required “more than a medical approach since resources had to be drawn from a number of government agencies that did not fall under the rubric of the MOH”, said authors Allen Lai and Tan Teck Boon, who were from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. \n They noted that it took five weeks after the first case was reported for the bureaucracy to adapt, though by then, the outbreak had already spread quickly out of TTSH. \n On April 7, 2003, a national control structure was created in response to SARS, comprising a nine-member inter-ministerial committee led by then Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng to provide strategic and political directions during health crises. \n Helping to coordinate across silos were a core executive group of senior civil servants, and an operations committee spanning ministries. Their functions were later consolidated during the H1N1 crisis, which meant that this leaner bureaucracy was quicker to respond to emerging situations on the ground. \n With the Wuhan coronavirus, observers said that it was evident that the Government had reacted more quickly than in SARS and H1N1 when it came to establishing a multi-disciplinary decision-making body. \n Professor Ooi Eng Eong, an infectious diseases expert and virologist at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, noted that a multi-ministry taskforce on the Wuhan coronavirus was formed on Jan 22, several hours before the first suspected case came to the attention of the authorities at 10pm the same day. The patient - a 66-year-old Chinese national tourist from Wuhan - tested positive the next day, becoming the first confirmed case in Singapore. \n “If you look at the response time, it is a fact that the ministerial committee formed before the case appeared, and we can see that a lot of systems are already in place, occurring across ministries and not as siloed as back then when SARS caught us all by surprise,” said Prof Ooi, who is also deputy director of the Emerging Infectious Diseases Programme at Duke-NUS Medical School. \n The taskforce was formed to direct the whole-of-government response to the outbreak, coordinate the public’s response and work with the international community. \n Jointly chaired by Health Minister Gan Kim Yong and National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, the taskforce comprises a cross-section of Cabinet ministers spanning various portfolios. They are: \n Dr Chia Shi-Lu, a Tanjong Pagar GRC Member of Parliament who chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee for Health, said that this time, the chain of command is clearer. \n He noted that even before the taskforce was formed, the MOH had already begun tracking the outbreak in China at the start of the year. Temperature screening measures were put in place at Changi Airport from as early as Jan 3. \n But the high political signature of the panel had led some to question whether too many cooks were spoiling the broth, Dr Chia noted. “In fact, some have asked me: Are we overdoing it?” he said. \n “I believe it is very important for everybody to come into the picture - you have to, because at this early stage, (the outbreak) affects so many different parts and you need leadership from them, and you cannot rely solely on MOH to coordinate everything,” he added. \n  \n INFRASTRUCTURE, CASE MANAGEMENT AND ISOLATION \n While information about the Wuhan virus is still emerging, Singapore is not in the same position as in the initial stages of the SARS outbreak in 2003, where it was - in the words of then Health Minister Lim Hng Kiang - “flying blind”. \n During the SARS crisis, Singapore only had two means to detect those infected with the virus: Their clinical symptoms and their travel history. Detecting these were not easy at the time as temperature screeners were also a rare resource, unlike today. \n “We have to depend on people taking temperature, and we have to depend on people being truthful to us in their contact history,” said Mr Lim then, describing SARS as a tremendous challenge. \n Dr Tan Yia Swam, First Vice-President of the Singapore Medical Association (SMA), said that in the SARS crisis, “there were too many unknowns, and precautions came too late, and too slowly”. SARS was zoonotic in nature, with the disease starting in animals before spreading to humans. \n As a result, policies and procedures regarding risk stratification, contact mapping, contact tracing, quarantine and others were developed on the fly as the epidemic erupted, she said. \n “Today, all of the above have been developed and tested before in exercises and they are now put into action. Of course, these plans, policies and procedures must be modified in line with the epidemiology of the disease, but we are not working from scratch, unlike the past experience with SARS,” she added. \n  \n Addressing the media on Monday, Mr Lawrence Wong said that in the taskforce’s national response to the virus, it is able to “marshal all available resources” to tackle the scourge. \n In terms of capacity, Singapore has already beefed up its healthcare and isolation capacity since 2003. This includes the 330-bed National Centre for Infectious Diseases that opened last year, and new hospitals such as Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in 2010, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital in 2015, and Sengkang General Hospital in 2018, he said. \n During SARS, TTSH was known as “SARSCentral”, the designated hospital to handle patients. This was borne out of a policy to restrict transmission of the virus to other hospitals, after a patient - who was unaware that he had been infected with the virus during his stay in TTSH - created a new viral cluster at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) when he went there for a surgical problem after his discharge from TTSH. \n This policy changed in 2009 during the H1N1 outbreak, with the Health Ministry imposing a standardised infection control measure on all healthcare facilities, empowered by timely tweaks to the Infectious Diseases Act. More than 400 family clinics were made “H1N1-ready” and equipped with the Tamiflu vaccine to handle the outbreak. \n  \n Similarly, all public hospitals are capable of handling the Wuhan virus today, and come equipped with isolation rooms, which were in short supply in 2003. \n When it came to medical supplies, Dr Chia recalled how there was hardly a stockpile of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers then, such as N95 respirators. \n “Because an N95 mask needs to fit well for it to perform its function, having a properly fitted mask was (hard to come by) during SARS, and we had to find time to do the fitting too,” said Dr Chia, who was an orthopaedic surgeon at SGH at the height of the crisis. \n “Today, most of us are already fitted with our own personal equipment, even as new staff. Everything is in place today,” he said. \n  \n For the general public, the Government will be disbursing a pack of four surgical masks to each of the 1.37 million Singapore households in a one-off exercise between Feb 1 and Feb 9. This was also done in 2003 when all households received a free emergency kit, containing N95 masks and themometers. \n This time round, the mask distribution comes amid long queues at pharmacies around the island as people clamour to buy masks, and retailers say their stocks of surgical masks and N95 masks are running low or sold out. The Government had released 5 million masks from its stockpile over nine days to the retailers but they were all snapped up in hours. \n Said Dr Chia: “The message is that there is enough for the whole of the population and in reserve too.” \n SMA’s Dr Tan said his association met with the College of Family Physicians Singapore over the Chinese New Year weekend to carry out “complex logistics arrangements” to ensure that there is a steady supply of surgical and N95 masks to replenish stocks for the frontline healthcare workers. \n “We are all monitoring the situation closely, and are ready to step up efforts when the need arises,” he said. \n Experts noted that contingency plans have been put in place too - student hostels are converted into quarantine facilities in anticipation of future cases, and the Outward Bound Singapore on Pulau Ubin has been marked as a possible quarantine site. \n  \n TRICKY BALANCE IN THE FACE OF IMPONDERABLES \n On Monday, Mr Lawrence Wong also called on Singaporeans to be psychologically prepared that the Wuhan virus could be worse than SARS given the many “imponderables” and “uncertainties” regarding the infection, though he stressed that there is still no evidence of community spread of the disease in Singapore. \n Over the past week, however, the first reports of human-to-human transmissions outside of China have surfaced in Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam and Germany. \n Mr Lawrence Wong said Singapore’s approach “is to anticipate and move as swiftly as we can”. “But every action we take really has to be based on evidence, data and international medical guidelines,” he added. \n  \n Unlike SARS, which impacted Singapore when little was known about it, there is now a greater understanding about the coronavirus, a family of viruses that include the Wuhan strain and SARS. \n But data gaps still exist, said Professor Tikki Elka Pangestu, a visiting fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and a former director of the WHO’s research policy and cooperation department in Geneva. \n Prof Pangestu said that not much is known of the proportion of mild and asymptomatic cases versus the severe and fatal ones, which currently makes it difficult to evaluate the Wuhan virus’ true epidemic potential and complicates the outbreak response. \n There is also the worry that the virus could mutate into a more virulent and more highly transmissible strain. “This needs close monitoring and another data gap will be in how quickly this development can be evaluated,” he said. \n Despite these gaps, Singapore has “reacted much more swiftly and comprehensively” than in 2003, Prof Pangestu added. \n  \n A rule of thumb for any country’s approach in health crises, he said, is to base decisions on scientific evidence and rational analysis in the context of its own capacities. \n “I think the Singapore approach is the correct one given the current information and evidence available - robust but not over-reactive and flexible enough to accommodate new developments,” said Prof Pangestu. \n He noted that overreaction risks imposing an unjustifiable burden on the country, potentially impacting normal daily routines and the livelihoods of certain vulnerable segments of the population. Under-reaction, on the other hand, would lead to a more extensive spread of the virus. \n “Calibrating the balance is tricky, but as I said, base your decisions on the existing scientific evidence,” said Prof Pangestu. \n Prof Ooi from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health added: “There is a risk and cost to overreaction and a cost to an under-reaction. Nobody knows what is the right answer and there is no hard science to it - this is a judgement call and there is no right or wrong.” \n Where there is a dearth of knowledge on imported pandemic cases, Singapore’s national strategy is flexible with the changing circumstances, and the plan recommends taking border control measures that would “err on the side of caution with more intense efforts until such time when the disease profile becomes clearer”. \n Addressing the media on Friday, Mr Lee said: “I think as a Government, in a way, we are overreacting because we are trying to look ahead to see what can go wrong and take preemptive steps to prevent that from happening.” \n Within a week, the taskforce moved from allowing travellers from Wuhan to enter Singapore while subject to enhanced screening on Monday, to imposing a complete entry ban on all nationalities who have been to China in the past 14 days on Friday. \n The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority has also stopped issuing all forms of new visas to those with People’s Republic of China passports. \n HANDLING A PSYCHOLOGICAL CRISIS \n Although the memory of SARS may have faded for some, experts say that the psychological lessons from it have remained until today, such that more Singaporeans are aware of the need to cooperate with the authorities during a health crisis. \n For example, social media is rife with examples of Singaporeans calling out bad actors, such as online sellers who hoard surgical masks to resell, or profiteering behaviour by certain businesses. The Government has also acted quickly to combat such behaviour. But Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, believes that the SARS legacy can also be a double-edged sword: The prospect of another SARS-like epidemic might lead to needless panic, or worse, “kiasuism”. \n  \n In a viral outbreak, being  “kiasu” means that people only think for themselves, preventing mutual cooperation from happening, he said. \n Urging Singaporeans to do better, Dr Leong said they should be prepared for the viral outbreak but not overdo it. If fear and panic take hold, they can overwhelm the country’s response “like a tsunami”, he said. \n This means Singapore’s national response has to preemptively address concerns that could lead to panic, he said. \n “You have no time to get ready. Better to be ready (for the worst) now than not ready at all … There is little room for mistakes (that create more panic),” said Dr Leong. \n  \n Dr Chia believes that Singaporeans are generally behaving in a rational way so far, based on his conversations with residents as an MP or his interactions with patients. \n “During SARS, there was a lot more fear and a sense of real danger for everyone. We had people trying to evade quarantine, refusing to cooperate or going for medical screening … But so far there are no cases of people who are trying to evade authorities, in other countries, yes, but not among Singaporeans,” he said. \n The rise of social media, which was non-existent during SARS , can also give rise to disinformation that fuels further panic. \n On the threat of fake news, SMA’s Dr Tan said: “Social media may do more harm than good in this kind of situation where fake news may spread faster than a virus and trigger unwanted behaviours. We urge all readers to exercise judgement when reading stories from various sources, and to keep referencing to official websites for accurate information.” \n STRONGER LEGISLATION \n Compared with the SARS crisis, Singapore has more legislative levers now to deal with fake news and anti-social behaviour - the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act being one of them. \n Lesser known are the many enhancements to the Infectious Diseases Act over the years since 2003, which give the authorities greater powers to enforce orders that were issued in the fight against a gazetted outbreak. \n The Act allows people who break home quarantine orders to be arrested without a warrant and to be jailed or fined on conviction. It was amended last year to allow officers to use “physical means” to enforce the order by bringing an absconder back to the place of isolation, in lieu of arrest. \n It also makes explicit that persons under legal orders that restrict their movement in Singapore, would not be allowed to leave the country, unless otherwise permitted. \n The breadth of such powers in Singapore gives the authorities the ability to ensure that evasion tactics, such as those described by Dr Chia, cannot happen again. The issue became such a problem during the SARS crisis that the health authorities had to resort to draconian measures, such as installing video surveillance cameras in the homes of people who were ordered to be quarantined. \n The lack of legal powers has created some difficulties for several foreign governments in dealing with the Wuhan coronavirus. Earlier this week, two Japanese citizens who were brought back to Japan from Wuhan on a chartered flight declined to go for medical screening when they landed in Tokyo. \n Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told the Japanese Parliament: \"While quarantine officers did their best to persuade them to go for further tests, they refused, and unfortunately there is no legal basis to force them to do so.\" \n MORAL SUASION AND IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC COMMS \n But over the longer term, evidence suggests that government measures such as quarantine and travel restrictions are not as effective as instilling a voluntary sense of social etiquette and responsibility among the people. \n Having a buy-in from the public is especially essential when the authorities need the people’s support to carry out certain measures, noted Prof Pangestu. \n  \n Prof Pangestu said: “You need the public’s cooperation for your measures to be successful, such as to follow good hygiene practices, be alert to any symptoms, promptly seeking healthcare, awareness of potential risks, and to counter the spread of misinformation on social media.” \n This will be critical during the “surge response” - when situational changes cause a sudden need for the authorities to ramp up its measures, such as activating quarantine sites that are being held in reserve. \n A lack of moral suasion would erase the ability for the Government to implement these measures, experts said. They noted how in Hong Kong, protesters bombed a general hospital and a residential building that the authorities had wanted to use as a possible quarantine facility. \n Over the past week, South Korean protesters - mostly residents - also used tractors to block access to facilities earmarked as quarantine centres in the cities of Asan and Jincheon, which are about 80km from Seoul. \n Experts said cooperation from the masses largely relies on public education as well as proper and accurate communication of risk, which is not always a guarantee considering the complex flow of information in a crisis situation that can lead to miscommunication. \n An April 2003 article in The Straits Times, \"All the right moves for SARSbut info’s a bit slow, no?\", by its then news editor Bertha Henson, described how the MOH was asked at a press conference to confirm a tipoff that SGH nurses might have SARS. The authorities said no, but it later emerged the next day that 21 SGH staff were on the SARS suspect list. \n “The kindest thing I can say about this sudden announcement is that the ministry gets its information later than the media,” wrote Ms Henson then. \n Referring to the incident, Professor Chee Yam Cheng, the current president of the Singapore Medical Council, wrote in a series of memos about SARS in 2003 that “quick dissemination of information - and accurate information - is almost as important as transparency in a health emergency”. \n Prof Pangestu believes that in general, Singaporeans are united and support what the Government is trying to do to contain the situation. \n “But public reaction is hard to control especially with fake news on social media. The idea that ‘perception is reality, anything is the truth’ often operates in this kind of (crisis) environment. That is why public risk communication is so important,” he said. \n Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram \n ",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "新加坡：与2003年非典（严重急性呼吸系统综合征）流行期间前线的许多其他人一样，蔡楚康（Choa Chu Kang）一家家庭诊所的资源已经捉襟见肘。\n个人防护装备——N95呼吸机、无菌手套和全身长袍——在世界上从来没有见过这种病毒的时候是稀缺的，世界各地的人们都在拼命地为自己储备应急物资。\n爱丁堡诊所的全科医生Tan Tze Lee博士回忆说，一线医护人员在采购设备以保护自己免受致命病毒感染时面临的困难。\n到2003年5月非典得到控制时，新加坡已有238人感染，33人死亡。五分之二的感染者是医护人员。\n虽然谭医生的诊所幸好没有遇到病例，但在新加坡疫情爆发的四个月里，它对SARS患者保持高度警惕，医护人员在这四个月里必须全副防护装备。但同时兼任新加坡家庭医生学院院长的谭博士说，每个人都没有做好应对危机的准备。\n他补充说，许多人继续工作，但极为担心他们可能会把病毒带回家，使他们的亲人处于危险之中。\n“新加坡的医疗从业人员准备不足，导致了惨淡的结果。从那时起，我们吸取了教训，并制定了措施，为今后的任何大流行事件做好准备。”\n他说：“我们今天就在这里，准备与2019年的nCoV战斗。\n1月23日，世界卫生组织（世卫组织）对武汉冠状病毒（即2019年nCoV）的临时名称）在新加坡首次得到确认。到目前为止，所有的病例都是进口的，包括一名在武汉的新加坡人，而且没有证据表明社区在共和国蔓延\n.\n世卫组织尚未宣布该病毒（已扩散到几个国家）为大流行。尽管如此，它在周五（1月31日）被宣布为全球卫生紧急事件。\n首批病例在中国湖北省武汉市报告，据信与出售活动物的华南海鲜批发市场有关。\n新加坡应对计划的核心是“疾病爆发应对系统”（DORS），该危机管理计划在2003不存在，但在SARS之后起草并在2009猪流感（或H1N1）大流行之后再次完善。\n李显龙总理上周在瑞士达沃斯出席世界经济论坛期间说：“非典之后，我们对我们拥有的设施进行了彻底的评估，包括基础设施、医院、隔离病房、科学测试和能力。”。\n“我想我们现在准备得好多了。”\n目前，新加坡正处于多尔松状态（DORSCON）黄色，表明该病毒严重，可在人与人之间传染，但主要发生在新加坡以外地区。下一步是多尔森奥兰治（DORSCON Orange），它本可以应用于非典型肺炎（SARS）病例中，病毒在新加坡传播，但传播范围不广，目前正在得到控制。\n医学专家和非典退伍军人说，虽然计划已经出台，一些措施已经启动，但新加坡的国家战略基本上还没有得到检验——因为据信武汉冠状病毒在共和国尚处于早期阶段。\n不过，他们表示，有充分迹象表明，随着新加坡加强防御，非典的教训正在得到应用。他们认为，与非典时期不同的是，新加坡现在准备得更充分了。\n吸取的教训\n在最近的记忆中，新加坡经历了两次大流行——非典和H1N1。\n虽然新加坡能够控制和恢复这两种病毒，但病毒的不同性质以及医学的变化意味着处理每一种病毒需要不同的方法\n.\n医生在治疗非典型肺炎病人时有有限的选择，只能实施支持性护理，而且没有任何办法可以预防感染。相比之下，当H1N1在新加坡夺去了18条生命，感染了40多万人时，疫苗和治疗方案是可用的，其中约1300人必须住院治疗。\n指挥和控制\n非典型肺炎于2003年2月底首次抵达新加坡，并于2003年3月1日在谭托克生医院（TTSH）发现一名患有非典型肺炎的妇女。当时，没有人知道它的致命性和毒性，第一个病人在医院里导致了42个病例的聚集。\n卫生部（卫生部）在马尔15日成立，两周前，新加坡发生了神秘的毒株，世卫组织发布了对香港爆发疫情的全球预警三天。\n但《奥地利东南亚研究杂志》（Austrian Journal of South east Asian Studies）2012年发表的一份研究报告称，当时的指挥和控制结构在一个变化无常、史无前例的危机形势下“完全不够”。\n该结构由卫生当局领导，但事后看来，它要求“不仅仅是一种医疗方法，因为资源必须从一些不属于卫生部职权范围的政府机构中提取”，作者Allen Lai和Tan Teck Boon说，他们来自李光耀公共政策学院。\n他们指出，在第一个病例被报告后，官僚机构花了五个星期才适应，不过到那时，疫情已经很快从TTSH蔓延出去。\n2003年4月7日，为应对非典，成立了一个由9名成员组成的部际委员会，由时任内政部长黄侃生领导，在卫生危机期间提供战略和政治指导。\n帮助跨部门协调是一个由高级公务员组成的核心执行小组，以及一个跨部门的业务委员会\n. 他们的职能后来在H1N1流感危机期间得到巩固，这意味着这种精简的官僚机构能够更快地应对当地出现的新情况。\n对于武汉冠状病毒，观察人士表示，很明显，在建立多学科决策机构方面，政府的反应比非典和H1N1更为迅速。\n索斯威霍克公共卫生学院传染病专家和病毒学家吴英昂教授指出，武汉冠状病毒多部门工作组于1月22日成立，几个小时后，第一例疑似病例于当天晚上10点提请当局注意。这名患者是一名来自武汉的66岁中国游客，第二天检测呈阳性，成为新加坡首例确诊病例。\n欧教授说：“如果你看看反应时间，事实上，在这起案件出现之前，部长委员会就已经成立了，我们可以看到，很多制度已经到位，发生在各个部委之间，不像当年非典让我们大吃一惊时那样孤立。”，世卫组织还担任杜克国立大学医学院新兴传染病方案副主任。\n该工作组的成立是为了指导政府应对疫情的整个行动，协调公众的反应，并与国际社会合作。\n该工作组由卫生部长甘金勇和国家发展部部长王立军共同主持，由内阁各部部长组成。他们是：\n担任政府议会卫生委员会主席的丹戎帕加尔GRC议员Chia Shi Lu博士说，这一次，指挥系统更加清晰。\n他指出，甚至在特遣部队成立之前，卫生部就已经开始跟踪中国今年年初的疫情。樟宜机场早在1月3日就已采取了降温措施\n.\n但Chia博士指出，专家组的高度政治性特征导致一些人质疑是否有太多的厨师在破坏肉汤。“事实上，有人问我：我们做得过火了吗？他说。\n他补充说：“我认为，每个人都要参与进来，这一点非常重要——你必须这样做，因为在这个早期阶段，（疫情爆发）影响到这么多不同的部分，你需要他们的领导，你不能仅仅依靠卫生部来协调一切。”。\n基础设施、案例管理和隔离\n虽然有关武汉病毒的信息仍在不断涌现，但新加坡与2003年非典爆发初期的情况并不相同，用当时的卫生部长林荣江的话说，当时的情况是“盲目飞行”。\n在非典危机期间，新加坡只有两种方法来检测感染者：他们的临床症状和旅行史。检测这些在当时并不容易，因为温度筛选机也是一种罕见的资源，不像今天。\n“我们必须依赖于人们的体温，我们必须依赖于人们在他们的接触史上对我们诚实，”当时林先生说，他形容非典是一个巨大的挑战。\n新加坡医学会（SMA）第一副会长谭耀泳博士说，在非典危机中，“未知数太多，预防措施来得太晚、太慢”。SARS在自然界是人畜共患的疾病，这种疾病在动物身上开始传播，然后传播到人类身上。\n她说，因此，随着疫情的爆发，有关风险分层、接触图绘制、接触者追踪、检疫等方面的政策和程序正在迅速发展。\n“今天，上述各项以前都是在演习中开发和试验的，现在已经付诸实施。当然，这些计划、政策和程序必须根据该病的流行病学进行修改，但我们并没有白手起家，这与过去非典的经验不同，”她补充说\n.\n周一，劳伦斯•黄在接受媒体采访时表示，在工作组对病毒的全国性反应中，它能够“调动所有可用资源”来对付这一祸害。\n在能力方面，新加坡自2003年以来已经加强了医疗和隔离能力。他说，这包括去年开放的有330张床位的国家传染病中心，以及2010年的霍德培医院、2015年的吴登芳总医院和2018年的盛港总医院等新医院。\n在SARS期间，TTSH被称为“SARSCentral”，是处理病人的指定医院。这是由于一项限制将病毒传播到其他医院的政策所证实的，此前，一名患者在新加坡综合医院（SGH）出院后前往那里接受外科手术时，不知道自己在TTSH期间感染了病毒，在新加坡综合医院创建了一个新的病毒群。\n这项政策在2009年H1N1疫情期间发生了变化，卫生部通过及时调整《传染病法》，对所有医疗设施实施了标准化的感染控制措施。400多家家庭诊所已经准备好了H1N1病毒，并配备了达菲疫苗来应对疫情。\n同样，所有公立医院都有能力处理武汉病毒，并配备隔离室，这些隔离室在2003年供不应求。\n谈到医疗用品，Chia博士回忆说，当时几乎没有为医护人员储备N95呼吸机等个人防护装备。\n“因为N95口罩需要很好的配合才能发挥其功能，所以在非典期间（很难买到）有一个合适的口罩，我们也必须找时间来做这个配合，”处于危机最严重时期的新加坡国立卫生院骨科医生Chia博士说。\n“今天，我们大多数人已经配备了自己的个人设备，即使是新员工\n. 今天一切都准备好了。”。\n政府将在2月1日至2月9日的一次性演习中，向137万新加坡家庭每人发放一包4个口罩。2003年，所有家庭都得到了一个免费的急救箱，里面有N95口罩和温度计。\n这一次，由于人们叫嚣着要购买口罩，岛上各地药店排起了长队，口罩分发工作正在进行中，零售商说，他们的外科口罩和N95口罩库存正在减少或售罄。政府在9天内从库存中向零售商发放了500万个口罩，但这些口罩都在数小时内被抢购一空。\nChia博士说：“这个信息是，这里有足够的人口，也有足够的储备。”\nSMA的谭博士说，协会在春节周末与新加坡家庭医生学院会面，进行“复杂的后勤安排”，以确保外科和N95口罩的稳定供应，为一线医护人员补充库存。\n他说：“我们都在密切关注局势，并准备在需要时加大努力。”。\n专家们注意到，应急计划也已经到位——学生宿舍被改造成隔离设施，以防将来发生病例，位于普兰岛的新加坡出境游也被标记为可能的隔离地点。\n面对无法估量的事物时的微妙平衡\n周一，王永明还呼吁新加坡人做好心理准备，考虑到在感染方面存在许多“无法估量”和“不确定因素”，武汉病毒可能会比非典更严重，不过他强调，目前仍没有证据显示这种疾病在新加坡社区传播。\n然而，在过去的一周里，在中国以外的台湾、日本、越南和德国出现了第一批人与人之间传播的报告\n.\n劳伦斯•黄表示，新加坡的做法“是尽可能快地预见并采取行动”。他补充说：“但我们采取的每一项行动都必须以证据、数据和国际医疗准则为基础。”。\n与非典不同，非典在鲜为人知的情况下影响了新加坡，现在人们对冠状病毒有了更深入的了解，冠状病毒是一个包括武汉株和非典在内的病毒家族。\n但是，李光耀公共政策学院的访问研究员Tikki Elka Pangestu教授和日内瓦世界卫生组织的研究政策和合作部门的前主任说，数据差距仍然存在。\n彭士图教授说，目前对轻症和无症状病例与重症和致命病例的比例知之甚少，这使得目前难以评估武汉病毒的真正流行潜力，并使疫情应对复杂化。\n人们还担心，这种病毒可能变异成一种毒性更强、传播能力更强的病毒株。他说：“这需要密切监控，另一个数据缺口将是评估这一发展的速度。”。\n尽管存在这些差距，但与2003年相比，新加坡的反应“更加迅速和全面”。\n他说，任何国家应对健康危机的方法的经验法则，都是以科学证据和自身能力范围内的理性分析为基础做出决定。\n“我认为新加坡的方法是正确的，考虑到现有的信息和证据-稳健的，但不是过度反应和灵活，足以适应新的发展，”Prof Pangestu说。\n他指出，过度反应有可能给国家带来不合理的负担，可能影响正常的日常生活和某些弱势群体的生计。另一方面，反应不足会导致病毒更广泛的传播\n.\n“校准平衡是棘手的，但正如我所说，把你的决定现有的科学证据，”Prof Pangestu说。\nSaw-Swee Hock公共卫生学院的Ooi教授补充道：“过度反应有风险和成本，反应不足也有成本。没有人知道什么是正确的答案，也没有难懂的科学——这是一个判断的召唤，没有对错之分。”\n在对进口大流行病例缺乏了解的情况下，新加坡的国家战略在不断变化的情况下是灵活的，并且该计划建议采取边境控制措施，“在疾病轮廓变得更清楚的时候，”在更为强烈的努力下“谨慎行事”。\n李明博周五在接受媒体采访时表示：“我认为，作为一个政府，在某种程度上，我们反应过度，因为我们正试图向前看，看看会出现什么问题，并采取先发制人的措施，防止这种情况发生。”\n在一周内，特别工作组从允许武汉的旅客在周一接受强化检查的同时进入新加坡，改为在周五对过去14天来中国的所有国籍实施全面入境禁令。\n移民和检查站管理局还停止向持有中华人民共和国护照的人发放各种形式的新签证。\n处理心理危机\n虽然对一些人来说，非典的记忆可能已经褪去，但专家说，从非典中汲取的心理教训一直延续到今天，因此，更多的新加坡人意识到在健康危机期间需要与当局合作。\n例如，社交媒体上充斥着新加坡人叫嚣不良行为者的例子，比如网上卖家囤积外科口罩转售，或者某些企业牟取暴利的行为。政府也迅速采取行动打击这种行为\n不过，伊丽莎白诺夫纳山医院传染病专家梁浩南博士认为，非典的后遗症也可能是一把双刃剑：另一场类似非典的疫情可能会导致不必要的恐慌，或者更糟的是“克钦独立主义”。\n他说，在病毒爆发时，成为“kiasu”意味着人们只为自己着想，阻止了相互合作的发生。\n梁振英博士敦促新加坡人做得更好，他说，他们应该为病毒爆发做好准备，但不能做得过火。他说，如果恐惧和恐慌占据了上风，它们会“像海啸一样”压倒国家的反应。\n他说，这意味着新加坡的国家应对措施必须先发制人地解决可能导致恐慌的担忧。\n“你没有时间准备。梁振英博士说：“现在最好做好准备（最坏的情况下），而不是一点都不准备……犯错误（造成更多恐慌）的空间很小。”。\nChia博士认为，根据他作为议员与居民的对话或与病人的互动，到目前为止，新加坡人的行为总体上是理性的。\n“非典期间，每个人都有更多的恐惧和真正的危险感。我们曾有人试图逃避检疫，拒绝合作或去做医学检查……但到目前为止，还没有人试图逃避当局，在其他国家，是的，但在新加坡人中没有。”。\n社交媒体的兴起，在SARS期间是不存在的，也会引起虚假信息，从而进一步加剧恐慌。\n关于假新闻的威胁，SMA的谭博士说：“在这种假新闻传播速度可能超过病毒并引发不必要行为的情况下，社交媒体可能弊大于利。我们敦促所有读者在阅读来自不同来源的报道时，要有判断力，并不断参考官方网站以获取准确的信息\n.”\n加强立法\n与非典危机相比，新加坡现在有更多的立法手段来处理假新闻和反社会行为——网络虚假和操纵行为的保护就是其中之一。\n鲜为人知的是自2003年以来对《传染病法》的许多改进，这些改进赋予了当局更大的权力，以执行在与一次已公布的疫情作斗争时发布的命令。\n该法允许违反家庭隔离令的人在没有逮捕令的情况下被逮捕，并在定罪后被监禁或罚款。去年修改后，允许警员使用“物理手段”执行命令，将潜逃者带回隔离地点，代替逮捕。\n它还明确规定，除非另有许可，否则根据限制其在新加坡流动的法律命令的人不得离开新加坡。\n新加坡这种权力的广度，使当局有能力确保类似Chia博士所描述的规避策略不会再次发生。在非典危机期间，这个问题变得如此严重，以至于卫生当局不得不采取严厉的措施，例如在被下令隔离的人的家中安装视频监控摄像机。\n由于缺乏法律权力，一些外国政府在处理武汉冠状病毒方面遇到了一些困难。本周早些时候，两名乘坐包机从武汉带回日本的日本公民在东京降落时拒绝接受体检。\n首相安倍晋三对日本国会说：“虽然检疫官员尽力劝说他们去做进一步的检查，但他们拒绝了，不幸的是，没有法律依据迫使他们这样做。”\n.\"\n道德劝诫与公共传播的重要性\n但从长期来看，有证据表明，政府采取的隔离和旅行限制等措施，不如在民众中灌输一种自愿的社会礼仪和责任感那么有效。\n当当局需要人民的支持来执行某些措施时，让公众的支持尤其重要，潘基斯托教授指出。\n潘基斯托教授说：“你需要公众的合作，才能使你的措施取得成功，比如遵循良好的卫生习惯，警惕任何症状，迅速寻求医疗保健，意识到潜在的风险，并阻止错误信息在社交媒体上的传播。”\n这将在“激增反应”期间至关重要——当情况变化导致当局突然需要加强其措施时，例如激活被保留的检疫点。\n专家表示，缺乏道德劝说将抹去政府执行这些措施的能力。他们指出，在香港，抗议者轰炸了一家综合医院和一幢住宅楼，当局希望以此作为可能的检疫设施。\n在过去的一周里，韩国抗议者——大部分是当地居民——还使用拖拉机，阻止他们进入距离首尔约80公里的阿桑市和金川市指定为检疫中心的设施。\n专家表示，群众的合作在很大程度上取决于公众的教育以及对风险的适当和准确的沟通，考虑到危机情况下复杂的信息流动可能导致沟通不畅，这并不总是一种保证。\n2003年4月在《海峡时报》上发表的一篇文章说，“对萨斯堡来说，一切都是正确的，但是信息有点慢，不是吗？”，当时的新闻编辑Bertha Henson描述了卫生部在记者招待会上如何被要求确认SGH护士可能患有非典型肺炎的消息\n. 当局说没有，但第二天晚些时候发现21名SGH工作人员被列入非典嫌疑人名单。\n“对于这一突然宣布，我能说的最好听的一件事是，外交部比媒体更晚获得信息，”当时汉森写道。\n谈到这一事件，新加坡医学会现任主席郑智彦教授在2003年的一系列关于非典的备忘录中写道，“快速传播信息——准确的信息——几乎与卫生紧急情况下的透明度同等重要”。\n潘基斯托教授认为，总体而言，新加坡人是团结一致的，支持政府为遏制局势所做的努力。\n但公众的反应很难控制，尤其是在社交媒体上的假新闻。在这种（危机）环境中，“感知即现实，一切即真理”的观念经常起作用。这就是公共风险沟通如此重要的原因。”。\n下载我们的应用程序或订阅我们的Telegram频道获取武汉病毒爆发的最新更新：https://cna.asia/Telegram\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "MANADO, Indonesia (Reuters) - Bat meat is still popular in some parts of Indonesia, despite research suggesting the coronavirus spreading from China might have originated in bats before being passed on to humans.\nBats are traditionally eaten by the Minahasan people from North Sulawesi in the form of a curry-like dish called Paniki. Whole bats are used in Paniki, including the head and wings.\n“It (the coronavirus) has not affected sales,” said bat seller Stenly Timbuleng at his stall in Tomohon, a city in North Sulawesi, south of the provincial capital of Manado.\n“In fact... sales continue. It is always sold out.”\nOn an average day, Timbuleng sells 50-60 bats and during festive periods, he can sell up to 600.\n“Bats are the favourite indigenous protein, particularly in North Sulawesi,” Indonesian culinary expert and author of half a dozen of cookbooks, William W. Wongso, told Reuters.\n“My favourite part is the wings,” Wongso added.\nGlands from the armpits and the neck of the bat are first removed to get rid of the bad smell.\nIt is then grilled or torched to get rid of the bat’s hairs before being chopped and cooked in a stew of herbs, spices and coconut milk.\nThe coronavirus is believed to have originated in a food market in the Chinese city of Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife. Health experts think it may have originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via another species,\nIn China, the virus has killed more than 1,000 and infected more than 42,700.\nThere are 319 coronavirus cases in 24 countries and territories outside of China, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Chinese health officials.\nNone has been reported in Indonesia, but the outbreak has prompted many Manadonese restaurants in the capital, Jakarta, to take bats off the menu.\nFor Manadonese Jufry Mantak, the links between the coronavirus and his favourite dish have not put him off.\n“We have not found any (coronavirus) cases in Manado.

On Thursday, Japan confirmed first death of an infected person- a second death outside China case after Philippines, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said.\nIn its daily coronavirus press conference, the WHO said that the number of laboratory confirmed cases in China have reached 46,550. The WHO also maintained that there were 447 cases in 24 countries, of which only two - Japan and Philippines - have reported deaths due to coronavirus. In India, one of the three infected persons in Kerala has been discharged.\nThe fatality rate of the new virus is still under scrutiny, since the outbreak hasn't ended. According to the data available till February 13, death rate in coronavirus (deaths over confirmed cases) is still much lower than other viral outbreaks such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Ebola virus.\nHowever, the death rate of the H1N1 Swine Flu (2009-10) outbreak is still much lower, though the estimated number of deaths by the H1N1 flu was still extremely high.\nOf the estimated 60,000 cases and over 1300 deaths, the death rate of novel coronavirus stands at 2.3 per cent.\nThe SARS outbreak of 2002-03 reported 8,096 cases of which 774 had died, thus a fatality rate of 9.6 per cent.\nThe death toll of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) was 11,325 between 2014-16 and recorded a death rate of 40 per cent.\nThe number of deaths due to the H1N1 in the 2009 outbreak was the highest among the four.\nIn Thursday' press conference, WHO director for health emergencies program Mike Ryan said, \"In terms of the international mission, the coronavirus advanced team and their Chinese counterparts have now finalised the scope of work and design of the mission. We expect the rest of the international team to start arriving in China over the weekend.\"\n",

Of 5,000 people evaluated for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 21.5% had obvious symptoms.\nThe hashtag #howtodealwithfeelingveryanxiousathome has been trending on social media platform Weibo, with more than 170 million views, as misinformation about the spread of the disease and travel bans feed public worries.\nThe hotlines are part of the government’s “first level response” for dealing with the psychological impact of major health emergencies, a strategy that was first deployed following the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, a disaster in which 87,150 people were killed or listed as missing.\nThe National Health Commission said more than 300 hotlines had launched across the country to provide mental health advice related to coronavirus, with support from university psychology departments, counseling services and NGOs.\nThey have been inundated by callers in a country which has just 2.2 psychiatrists available for every 100,000 people, according to WHO data, five times fewer than in the United States.\nA national hotline run by Beijing Normal University was overwhelmed when it went live at the end of January, said Cheng Qi, a Shanghai-based psychologist.\nWhile the number of calls has dropped as other lines opens, the content has become more challenging, Cheng said, noting one caller with chronic depression who had reported suicidal thoughts triggered by the barrage of bad news.\n“It’s not the virus [that caused it], but the virus is stimulating it,” she said.\nXu Wang, a psychotherapist at Tsinghua University, which is working with the official Beijing city hotline, said a major challenge was working out which callers showed real symptoms of the virus and which were instead suffering from anxiety.\n“Callers often have somatic issues, and might say, ‘I can’t eat well, can’t sleep well, and I want to know if it’s a virus infection,’” he said.\nA volunteer group of more than 400 therapists called ‘Yong Xin Kang Yi’, which roughly translates to ‘Use Heart to Fight the Virus’, focuses on helping overworked medical staff in Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus.\n“They leave messages saying they’re exhausted, that they’re scared,” Cui said. “The doctors don’t know if they’re going to get infected or if their co-workers or going to get infected, and they don’t know how bad it’s spreading.”\nMedical researchers from Peking University included telephone and internet counseling for healthcare staff, patients, and the public among six key strategies for coping with mental stress over the coronavirus outbreak.\n“We believe that including mental health care in the national public health emergency system will empower China and the world during the campaign to contain and eradicate\n2019-nCoV,” the researchers said in a paper published in The Lancet medical journal last week.\nThe government recently issued guidance for the hotlines, saying they should be free, confidential, staffed by volunteers with relevant professional backgrounds and supervised by experienced by experts.\nStill, concerns remain about enforcement.\n“There are many individually initiated helplines and it’s difficult to gain consistent support and supervision,” said Sami Wong, a Beijing-based psychotherapist.\nTsinghua University’s Xu said the very nature of the hotlines added to the challenges, preventing volunteers from gaining much-needed face-to-face experience with people suffering mental health issues.\nWong worried that untrained volunteers could easily put their foot in their mouth. A seemingly innocuous “I can understand how you feel” can cause vulnerable people to clam up, she said: “PTSD training is not something you can learn overnight.”\n(This story corrects transliteration of names in paragraphs 3, 15 and 16)\n",

It has risen 4.8% since last Friday, its first weekly increase in six weeks.\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) CLc1 was 70 cents or 1.4% higher at $52.12 a barrel, up 3.6% for the week.\n“It would seem in our view that the oil price is on a more positive footing in the past couple of days, with improved sentiment reflected in Asian equity prices holding up,” said BNP Paribas analyst Harry Tchilinguirian.\nMore than 1,350 people have died from the coronavirus in China, which has disrupted the world’s second largest economy and shaken energy markets. Brent has fallen 15% since the beginning of the year.\nHowever, market sentiment improved as factories in China started to reopen and the government eased its monetary policy.\nThe World Health Organization also reassured traders by saying the big jump in China’s reported cases reflected a decision by authorities to reclassify a backlog of suspected cases, and did not necessarily indicate a wider epidemic.\nSome officials and analysts were still hopeful that the demand impact would remain limited to China.\n“Our baseline thesis remains that oil demand destruction remains largely a China story and has yet to spill over to impact global demand,” said Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at Citadel Magnus.\nU.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette told Reuters the coronavirus epidemic in China had had a marginal impact on energy markets and was unlikely to dramatically affect oil prices even if Chinese demand fell by 500,000 barrels per day.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) said that first-quarter oil demand was set to fall versus a year earlier for the first time since the financial crisis in 2009 because of the coronavirus outbreak.\n“Given the strength seen in the market this week, it suggests participants were factoring in even larger demand hits as a result of COVID-19 (the coronavirus),” said ING analyst Warren Patterson.\n(Graphic: Chinese, World Oil Demand Growth, y-o-y -  here[1].jpg)\nIn response to the demand slump, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied producers, a grouping known as OPEC+, are considering cutting output by up to 2.3 million barrels per day.\n“The decision ultimately rests with the Kremlin, and if favourable, then we are likely to see a relief rally in oil, arguably mitigated by recent U.S. dollar strength,” said Tchilinguirian.\nUBS investment bank said in a note that commodity demand concerns were likely to linger and “the asset class should display a fair bit of volatility in the coming weeks”.\n“We assume China’s economic activity as well as commodity demand will recover from 2Q20 onwards,” it said, referring to the second quarter of 2020.\n(Graphic: OPEC crude supply - here)\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Robust iron ore prices drove BHP Group to its best result in five years, still slightly off estimates, with the miner saying containment this quarter of a coronavirus that is spreading around the globe should limit any economic impact.\nBHP’s underlying profit from continuing operations rose to $5.19 billion for the six months ended Dec. 31 from $4.03 billion a year earlier, the strongest result since the same period of 2015, lifted by lofty iron ore prices after last year’s supply disruption out of Brazil and solid Chinese demand.\nThe results were below estimates of a profit of $5.28 billion, according to analysts polled by research firm Vuma Financial. An interim dividend of 65 cents, 10 cents higher than last year, undershot forecasts for a dividend of 71 cents.\nThe dividend came in “below market as board takes conservative approach given coronavirus (63% pay-out vs 70% 3-yr average),” UBS said in a note.\nBHP has not yet seen a major impact on its business from the coronavirus that was discovered in China at the end of last year, and customers have kept paying for their orders, the miner’s new chief executive, Mike Henry, said on Tuesday.\nHe added, though, that other supply disruptions have lent support to iron ore.\n“We are moving all of our product. Demand remains pretty resilient. Prices have held up in part because of some other supply side disruptions,” Henry said.\nRio Tinto downgraded its forecast for iron ore shipments for the year on Monday after a cyclone off the coast of Western Australia earlier this month.\nBHP is the first among its peers to report its earnings. Global miners are all expected to have cashed in on last year’s higher iron ore prices, with a further boost coming as China pumped more money into its economy to alleviate an economic slowdown. China’s iron ore imports were at their second-highest level ever in 2019, further boosting profits.\nThe world’s biggest miner is positioning itself well in a world that is decarbonising, Henry also said.\nBHP is seeking to raise its exposure to “future facing” commodities copper and nickel, through exploration and early stage acquisition, he said, adding that it would be open to selling its thermal coal assets if it can find a buyer at the right price given the deteriorating prospects for the market.\n“We need more copper and we need more nickel,” Henry told reporters as he pledged to meet “social value” commitments.\nBHP has also been using more renewable power, is assembling targets to scale back so-called “scope three” emissions - or the emissions of its customers - and is completing a review into industry associations that it funds to ensure they comply with its climate change goals.\nAs it seeks to improve efficiencies within the company, BHP will also look at restructuring its technological operations and making more staff permanent, Henry said.\nShares rose 0.9 percent on Tuesday to $A38.83 amid an uplift in the mining sector after Beijing stepped up stimulus to cushion the impact of the corona virus outbreak.\nFree cash flow for the miner came in at $3.7 billion, compared with $3.6 billion a year earlier.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "For the past two weeks China's police have been raiding houses, restaurants and makeshift markets across the country, arresting nearly 700 people for breaking the temporary ban on catching, selling or eating wild animals.\nThe scale of the crackdown, which has netted almost 40,000 animals including squirrels, weasels and boars, suggests that China's taste for eating wildlife and using animal parts for medicinal purposes is not likely to disappear overnight, despite potential links to the new coronavirus.\nTraders legally selling donkey, dog, deer, crocodile and other meat told Reuters that they plan to get back to business as soon as the markets reopen.\n\"I'd like to sell once the ban is lifted,\" said Gong Jian, who runs a wildlife store online and operates shops in China's autonomous Inner Mongolia region. \"People like buying wildlife. They buy for themselves to eat or give as presents because it is very presentable and gives you face.\"\nGong said that he was storing crocodile and deer meat in large freezers but would have to kill all the quails he had been breeding as supermarkets were no longer buying his eggs and they cannot be eaten after freezing.\nScientists suspect, but have not proven, that the new coronavirus passed to humans from bats via pangolins, a small ant-eating mammal whose scales are highly prized in traditional Chinese medicine.\nSome of the earliest infections were found in people who had exposure to Wuhan's seafood market, where bats, snakes, civets and other wildlife were sold. China temporarily shut down all such markets in January, warning that eating wild animals posed a threat to public health and safety.\nThat may not be enough to change tastes or attitudes that are deeply rooted in the country's culture and history.\n\"In many people's eyes, animals are living for man, not sharing the earth with man,\" said Wang Song, a retired researcher of Zoology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\nONLINE DEBATE\nThe outbreak of the new coronavirus, which has killed more than 1,600 people in China, revived a debate in the country about the use of wildlife for food and medicine. It previously came to prominence in 2003 during the spread of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which scientists believe was passed to humans from bats, via civets.\nMany academics, environmentalists and residents in China have joined international conservation groups in calling for a permanent ban on trade in wildlife and closure of the markets where wild animals are sold.\nOnline debate within China, likely swayed by younger people, has heavily favored a permanent ban.\n\"One bad habit is that we dare to eat anything,\" said one commenter called Sun on a news discussion forum on Chinese website Sina. \"We must stop eating wildlife and those who do should be sentenced to jail.\"\nNevertheless, a minority of Chinese still like to eat wild animals in the belief it is healthy, providing the demand that sustains wildlife markets like that in Wuhan and a thriving online sales business, much of which is illegal.\nOne online commenter calling themselves Onlooker Pharaoh said on Chinese news platform Hupu that the risk was worth it: \"Giving up wildlife to eat as food is like giving up eating because you might choke.\"\nGOVERNMENT SUPPORT\nThe breeding and trading of wild animals in China is supported by the government and is a source of profit for many people.\nAfter the SARS outbreak, the National Forestry and Grassland Administration (NFGA) strengthened oversight of the wildlife business, licensing the legal farming and sale of 54 wild animals including civets, turtles and crocodiles, and approved breeding of endangered species including bears, tigers and pangolins for environmental or conservation purposes.\nThese officially sanctioned wildlife farming operations produce about $20 billion in annual revenue, according to a 2016 government-backed report.\n\"The state forestry bureau has long been the main force supporting wildlife use,\" said Peter Li, a China Policy Specialist for the Humane Society International. \"It insists on China's right to use wildlife resources for development purposes.\"\nMuch of the farming and sale of wildlife takes place in rural or poorer regions under the blessing of local authorities who see trading as a boost for the local economy. State-backed television programs regularly show people farming animals, including rats, for commercial sale and their own consumption.\nHowever, activists pushing for a ban describe the licensed farms as a cover for illegal wildlife trafficking, where animals are specifically bred to be consumed as food or medicine rather than released into the wild.\n\"They just use this premise to do illegal trading,\" Zhou Jinfeng, head of China's Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation, told Reuters. \"There are no real pangolin farms in China, they just use the permits to do illegal things.\"\nThe NFGA did not respond to requests for comment.\nBLURRED LINES\nAnimal products, from bear bile to pangolin scales, are still used in some traditional Chinese medicine, an industry China wants to expand as part of its Belt and Road Initiative.\nBut the distinction between legal and illegal is blurred. The United Nations estimates the global illegal wildlife trade is worth about $23 billion a year. China is by far the largest market, environmental groups say.\nThe Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), an independent organization based in London which campaigns against what it sees as environmental abuses, said in a report this week the coronavirus outbreak has in fact boosted some illegal wildlife trafficking as traders in China and Laos are selling rhinoceros horn medicines as a treatment to reduce fever.\nChina's top legislature will toughen laws on wildlife trafficking this year, the official Xinhua news agency reported this week.\n\"We are in a sun-setting business,\" said Xiang Chengchuan, a wholesale wildlife store owner in the landlocked eastern Anhui province. \"Few people eat dogs now, but it was popular 20 years ago.\"\nXiang, who sells gift boxes of deer antlers and dog, donkey and peacock meat to wealthy bank clients and others, said he had frozen his meat as he waits to see if the ban will continue.\n\"I will resume selling once the policy allows us, but now I have no idea how long it [the ban] will last.\"\n",

Car makers are idling plants for lack of parts.\nThe yield curve between U.S. three-month bills and 10-year notes inverted overnight, a bearish economic signal, and German investor confidence slumped as its economy stagnates, sending the euro cheaper than $1.08 for the first time since 2017.\n“The market is trying to model itself on coronavirus and it’s struggling really hard to understand how that goes and that’s pushing capital in to the U.S.,” said Chris Weston, head of research at Melbourne brokerage Pepperstone.\n“The U.S. remains that least-dirty T-shirt, the best house in a fairly shabby-looking neighbourhood. As a destination for capital, it’s still the light that you look for.”\nAgainst a basket of currencies, the greenback is sitting by a four-month high at 99.452. It touched a one-week high against the Australian and New Zealand dollars overnight.\nBoth Antipodean currencies are heavily exposed to China, and both have lost roughly 5% against the dollar this year . Norway’s krone, sensitive to the global growth outlook via oil exports, has shed 6% in 2020 and slumped to an 18-year low overnight.\nThe euro has fallen 3.7% amid increasing signs of divergence between the European and U.S. economies.\nThe single currency last bought $1.0796. Moves in major currencies were slight in morning trade.\nChina says figures indicating a slowdown in new cases in recent days show the aggressive steps it has taken to curb travel and commerce are slowing the spread of the disease beyond central Hubei province and its capital, Wuhan.\nThat has not stopped worries mounting, with hedge funds turning to proxies from railway movements to port activity and air pollution to try and gauge how much production remains offline.\nGold is sitting above $1,600 an ounce for the first time since U.S.-Iran tensions in the Middle East sent it spiking in early January. Priced in euros, gold’s value jumped almost 2% to a record high overnight.\nInvestors are looking to the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s January meeting, due to be released at 1900 GMT, for insight in to the Fed’s thinking about virus risks.\nEuropean purchasing managers index numbers and part-month Korean export figures, both due on Friday, are also going to be closely watched for the first hard signs of economic impact.\n“We assess the risks are firmly skewed towards the negative effects of COVID-19 lasting longer,” Nomura analysts wrote in a note, using the World Health Organisation’s designation for the illness caused by the coronavirus.\n“Therefore, we maintain our cautious view through positions in long USD/THB, long USD/CNH, long USD vs GBP, NZD and long AUD/NZD.”\nChina’s yuan was last steady at 7.0017 per dollar in offshore trade.

Lu Hongzhou, professor and co-director of the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre, said that 184 cases were still hospitalized, including 166 mild cases, while 18 were in serious and critical conditions.\nHe said the hospital had set up a special clinic to administer plasma therapy and was selecting patients who were willing to donate. The blood would be screened to check if he or she had other diseases like hepatitis B or C, he added.\n“We are positive that this method can be very effective in our patients,” he said.\nThere are no fully licensed treatments or vaccines against the new coronavirus, and the process of developing and testing drugs can take many months and even years.\nConvalescent plasma has been proven “effective and life-saving” against other infectious diseases, including rabies and diphtheria, Dr. Mike Ryan, head of WHO’s health emergencies program, told reporters in Geneva.\n“It is a very important area to pursue,” Ryan said.\n“Because what hyperimmune globulin does is it concentrates the antibodies in a recovered patient. You are essentially giving the new victim’s immune system a boost of antibodies to hopefully get them through the very difficult phase.\n“So it must be given at the right time, because it mops up the virus in the system, and it just gives the new patient’s immune system a vital push at the time it needs it. But it has to be carefully timed and it’s not always successful.”\nRyan added: “So it is a very important area of discovery, and I believe they are starting trials on that in China. But it is a very valid way to explore therapeutics, especially when we don’t have vaccines and we don’t have specific antivirals.”\nAs well as using plasma therapies, the Chinese doctors are also trying antiviral drugs licensed for use against other infections to see if they might help.\nScientists are testing two antiviral drugs and preliminary results are due in weeks, while the head of a Wuhan hospital had said plasma infusions from recovered patients had shown some encouraging preliminary results.\n",

Other news reports said Iran had recently evacuated 60 Iranian students from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the epicenter of the epidemic.\nQom, located around 140 kilometers (86 miles) south of the capital, Tehran, is a popular religious destination and a center of learning and religious studies for Shiite Muslims from inside Iran, as well as Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan and Azerbaijan. It is also known for its cattle farms.\nAn official in Iran’s health ministry, Kiyanoush Jahanpour said on his twitter account that the number of confirmed cases of the virus in Iran was five, including the two elderly Iranian citizens who died on Wednesday in Qom.\nIRNA reported that the three new cases are all Iranians residing in Qom, with one of the infectedhaving visitedthe city of Arak. Mohammad Mahdi Gouya, Iran’s deputy health minister, said they did not appear to have had any contact with Chinese nationals.\nIranian authorities were now investigating the origin of the disease, and its possible link with religious pilgrims from Pakistan or other countries.\nIran’s health minister, Saeed Namaki said the roughly 60 Iranian students evacuated from Wuhan had been quarantined upon their return to Iran and were discharged after 14 days without any health problems.\nIran once relied heavily on China to buy its oil and some Chinese companies have continued doing business with Iran in the face of U.S. sanctions. Unlike other countries such as Saudi Arabia, which barred its citizens and residents from traveling to China Iran has not imposed such measures on travel there.\nThe new virus emerged in Wuhan, China in December. Since then, more than 75,000 people have been infected globally, with more than 2,000 deaths being reported, mostly in China.\nThe new virus comes from a large family of coronaviruses, some causing nothing worse than a cold. It causes cold- and flu-like symptoms, including cough and fever, and in more severe cases, shortness of breath. It can worsen to pneumonia, which can be fatal. The World Health Organization recently named the illness it causes COVID-19, referring to both coronavirus and its origin late last year.\nThe virus has had few cases in the Middle East so far. There have been nine cases of the virus confirmed in the United Arab Emirates, which is a popular tourist destination, and one case in Egypt. Of the nine in the UAE, seven are Chinese nationals, one is a Filipino and another an Indian national.\nMeanwhile, Egypt’s national air carrier announced Thursday that it would resume flights to China as of Feb. 27 after nearly three weeks of suspension.\n",

Another 19 cases were in neighboring North Gyeongsang province towns.\nA US military statement said the 23-year-old soldier who tested positive was in self quarantine at his off-base residence. He had been based in Camp Caroll in a town near Daegu, and visited Camp Walker in Daegu earlier this week.\nThe military said South Korean authorities and US military health professionals tracing his contacts to determine if other people may have been exposed.\nSouth Korea now has 1,146 confirmed infections of the virus and 11 fatalities from the COVID-19 illness it causes. The national government has been channeling medical personnel, protective suits and other supplies to Daegu, and there are concerns the local hospitals are being overwhelmed and fatigued doctors are becoming vulnerable to infections.\n\"This week will be critical in the fight to combat the (COVI-19) illness,\" Prime Minister Chung Se-kyun said at meeting in Daegu City Hall to discuss quarantine efforts.\nThe number of cases were expected to rise as health workers were working to finish testing hundreds of members of the Daegu branch of a church that has the country's biggest cluster of infections. The Shincheonji Church of Jesus, which mainstream Christian organizations describe as a cult, agreed to hand over a list of 200,000 members nationwide so screenings could widen.\nChina, by far, still has the most cases and deaths from the illness, though its numbers have slowed recently.

Four former passengers on the ship have died and more than a dozen people who were evacuated by their home countries later tested positive for the virus.

        "news_content_translate_en": "(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters)\n* CME Copper Money Manager Positioning: tmsnrt.rs/3a30Zbh\nBy Andy Home\nLONDON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Funds have given up on their early-year hopes for higher copper prices.\nInvestors have turned bearish on the CME copper contract , slashing long positions and putting on fresh bets for lower prices.\nThe net money manager short is now back at levels last seen in the third quarter of 2019, when market sentiment hit a “trade war” trough.\nThe deadly coronavirus has frozen the expected Chinese manufacturing recovery story and is now showing signs of spreading to South Korea, another industrial powerhouse.\nWhile equity markets have been taking a more sanguine view of the medium-term economic impact of the virus, copper is starting to price in the multiple short-term impacts on the physical supply chain.\nThis is not just a demand story, however, since logistics problems are also affecting China’s copper producers. That adds another layer of uncertainty to an already complex mix.\nMoney managers were net short of CME copper to the tune of 55,373 contracts as of Feb. 18, according to the latest Commitments of Traders report.\nPositioning was little changed week on week but the turnaround since the start of the year has been stark.\nThe money men shifted to net long in December as China’s stuttering manufacturing engine showed signs of recovery.\nHowever, those long positions have been slashed from over 81,511 contracts in the middle of January to a current 43,694. Fresh short positions have accumulated over the same time frame with money managers now holding almost 100,000 contracts of bear bets.\nThe collective negativity is the worst since peak trade-war blues in the third quarter of last year.\nHedge fund managers appear more focused on the current state of the physical copper market than the promise of a sharp economic rebound in China when Beijing unleashes the investment taps.\nBut then, as analysts at Goldman Sachs point out, the size of the short-term disruption is “unprecedented”. (“The impact of 2019-nCoV on industrial metals”, Feb. 14, 2020)\nQuarantining and restrictions on movement at a time when migrant workers would normally be expected to be returning to work mean the number of “missing work days” in China is roughly “equivalent to the entire U.S. workforce taking an unplanned break for two months.”\nGoldman has just cut its three, six and 12-month copper price forecasts from $6,300, $6,500 and $7,000 per tonne to $5,900, $6,200 and $6,500 respectively.\nThe investment bank argues that the virus represents “a meaningful demand shock for copper” and is modelling a demand decline of 18% year on year in the first quarter.\nThe promise of future stimulus risks blinding investors to “the physical realities of the disruption today,” (“Promise of stimulus builds downside risk to commodities”, Feb. 21, 2020).\nAnalysts at Citi agree.\n“Our base case is for physical market weakness to dominate futures buying over the coming weeks,” it said. (“Metals Weekly,” Feb. 18, 2020).\n“The Chinese demand recovery is likely to be more gradual than many expect, since more than three-quarters of migrant workers are yet to return post (Chinese New Year), and half of these are not expected to return until March,” the bank adds.\nA big short-term hit to copper demand will translate into surging inventories, which will in turn require hedge short positions to be built on the CME and London Metal Exchange (LME).\nCiti estimates that 500,000 to 700,000 tonnes of industrial short positions could be seen, pressuring prices further.\nIt’s possible a massive counter-build in speculative positioning could compensate but it would require a sharp shift in the coronavirus news-flow such as a clinical drug breakthrough.\nSigns of surplus metal are already starting to show in China.\nStocks of copper registered with the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) have ballooned from 124,000 tonnes at the start of January to 298,600 tonnes.\nChinese copper inventory always rises over the new year holiday period but this year’s 175,000-tonne surge is already outpacing the peak January-March build of 143,000 tonnes in 2019 and 156,000 tonnes in 2018.\nInventories at bonded warehouses in Shanghai are also thought to be rising.\nThe pronounced contango across the front part of the ShFE copper futures curve suggests the local market is expecting more surplus metal to appear in the coming weeks.\nMitigating some of the demand shock may be lower Chinese copper production as smelters face their own physical supply-chain headaches.\nSmelters are struggling both to receive enough mined concentrate to keep running and to sell the sulphuric acid they generate as a by-product of making copper.\n“There is a general loss of efficiency across the concentrates supply chain from ports to smelters due to restrictions on movement and extension of holidays for couriers, customs brokers, customs, etc.,” according to research house Wood Mackenzie.\nIt notes that multiple Chinese smelters are experiencing concentrates delivery delays.

IAG said further cancellations would follow in the coming days.\nLower air traffic growth projections prompted Spanish travel technology firm Amadeus (AMA.MC) to forecast slower 2020 core profit growth on Friday, but it stressed the outlook did not yet account for the uncertain impact of the coronavirus outbreak.\nTo deal with the drop in business, IAG said it was cutting costs, without giving details - joining the likes of Germany’s Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) and Amsterdam-based KLM (AIRF.PA) which have announced similar plans.\nIt also said flight cancellations would reduce capacity growth this year, although CEO Willie Walsh said the group could start to add capacity if other airlines failed.\nAirline stocks have been among the biggest casualties of a stock market rout this week as coronavirus fears have gripped investors. At 0845 GMT, IAG shares were down 8% at 474.59 pence, while easyJet (EZJ.L) stock was down 3% at 1,075 pence and Finnair (FIA1S.HE) was off 3.4% at 4.922 euros.\n(Graphic: Europe's Airlines - here)\nBudget carrier EasyJet reported a “significant” softening of demand into and out of its bases in northern Italy - the center of the biggest coronavirus outbreak in Europe - and a reduction across its other European markets.\nIt also said it would be cancelling some flights, particularly into and out of Italy, and that it would make cost savings across its business, without giving details.\n“We continue to monitor the situation carefully and will update the market in due course,” it said, adding it was too early to determine the impact on its results.\nFinnair, meanwhile, warned of a “significant” fall in operating profit this year due to virus-related disruption.\nFinland’s national airline also said its was scrapping its 2020 capacity growth target, and would look into cutting costs by 40-50 million euros ($44-54 million), with measures under consideration including temporary layoffs.\n",

A continued output decline in the automotive industry, which accounts for about one fifth of BASF’s business, was tempering moderate growth in most other customer industries, it added.\nAdjusted EBIT increased by 23% to 765 million euros in the fourth quarter ended December, beating analysts’ projections thanks to a stronger-than-expected agriculture business.\nBASF said it was speeding up a program of cutbacks that started last year and will see the reduction of 6,000 jobs. The group is now eyeing 1.3-1.5 billion euros in cost cuts this year, more than the 1-1.3 billion initially targeted.\nSpending on plants and equipment would be “disciplined” this year, it added, with the investment budget edging higher to 3.4 billion euros from 3.3 billion last year as it builds sites in Guangdong, China and Mundra, India and seeks to boost battery materials output.\n",

But we’re also at the height of the flu season which traditionally is January and February in the winter and then it tapers off and goes down in the warmer months,” he said.\n“So if it follows that kind of a pattern, by the time we get to April, May and June it may be a thing of the past.”\nPound’s comments came on the same day Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for a two-week curb on sports events as two more coronavirus deaths in the country heightened concerns the outbreak might scupper the Tokyo Olympics.\nA number of international sports events have been hit by the coronavirus, with some competitions being postponed and others canceled outright.\nThe flu-like virus is believed to have originated in a market selling wildlife in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and has infected about 80,000 people and killed more than 2,700, the vast majority in China.\nPound said if there does come a need to reschedule the Olympics, they could theoretically be postponed until the same time period in 2021, but not for later this year because it would interfere with the packed regular sports schedule.\n“Especially in North America and Europe because all the college sports are on, football is on, baseball is on,” said Pound. “A lot (of) sports on the air and if you throw in this Olympic tsunami on top of it, it would be very bad.”\nPound said the IOC remains in constant contact with the World Health Organization and would need that organization to weigh in over whether to hold or cancel the Games and if other options should be considered.\n“Our plan is that unless the elephant in the room becomes ginormous, we’re going to open the Games on July 24,” Pound said.\n“That’s where were headed at the moment, and unless we are diverted from that by public authorities and health authorities we’ll go ahead.”\n",

Firstly, fuel inventories have to be drawn down and secondly March is traditionally a month when several refiners undertake scheduled maintenance, as it falls in the shoulder season between peak winter and summer demand.\nThere is also a difference between Chinese domestic fuel consumption, and the country’s overall crude demand, given Beijing is still filling its strategic petroleum reserve, and refiners are also boosting exports of refined products.\nThis means that while some estimates suggested Chinese fuel demand fell by up to 4 million barrels per day (bpd) this month as the coronavirus led to the quarantining of entire cities, the hit to crude imports may not be so dramatic.\nChina’s crude imports are expected at 10.53 million bpd for February, down from 10.69 million bpd in January, according to a report on Wednesday by Refinitiv Oil Research.\nA mere drop of 160,000 bpd isn’t much of a dent to demand, and if the final tally is in line with the Refinitiv forecast, it will put some of the more doom-laden predictions about China’s crude demand into perspective.\nHowever, it’s likely that the bigger hit to China’s oil imports will come in March, and possibly extend into April.\nRefinitiv vessel-tracking data is showing 136 vessels carrying 177.6 million barrels are already heading to China and expect to unload in March, already over half the expected deliveries in an average recent month.\nThis will also be far from the final total, given that more cargoes are likely to leave Middle Eastern and Russian ports in the next two weeks and still have time to reach China before the end of March.\nWhat the vessel-tracking and port data is suggesting is that while China’s imports of crude may be softer than they would have been in the absence of the coronavirus, they are still holding up pretty well and the drop is nowhere near as severe as the hit to domestic fuel consumption.\nIf Chinese crude imports do start to recover from April onwards, it means the market focus is likely shift to how big the impact of the coronavirus will be on the rest of the world.\nWith more new cases being reported outside of China for the first time on Wednesday, the risks are rising that the coronavirus may reach vulnerable countries in Africa and the Middle East, and could strain health systems even in developed countries.\nIt’s still a wait-and-see approach, but if travel bans and quarantine measures become commonplace across Europe, even forecasts for zero global oil demand this year may prove optimistic.\nHowever, the epidemic, along with fears that it may become a pandemic, is driving a slump in crude prices, with Brent futures dropping as low as $52.57 a barrel in early Asian trade on Thursday, the weakest intraday price in a year, and putting the decline since the peak this year on Jan. 8 to nearly 27%.\nAssuming China does contain the virus and its economy starts to recover as stimulus hopes are delivered, the current weak crude price may also drive increased buying for its strategic stockpiles.\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "（这里表达的观点是作者路透社专栏作家的观点。）\n作者：克莱德·拉塞尔\n路透澳大利亚劳恩斯顿2月27日电（记者LAUNCESTON）---中国冠状病毒在全球范围内的传播，可能抹杀了2020年全球原油需求的增长，但具有讽刺意味的是，如果任何增长势头得以延续，很可能将由中国负责。\n毫无疑问，冠状病毒始于武汉市，迄今已造成2700多人死亡，它将在本月打击中国原油消费，并可能持续到3月和4月。\n不过，北京方面似乎也终于开始着手控制这种病毒了，就像它在其他国家（尤其是韩国、日本、伊朗和意大利）的蔓延一样。\n这使得中国炼油企业很可能热衷于恢复因病毒而缩减的业务，但这可能会推迟到4月份。\n中国延迟恢复全部原油加工有两个原因。首先，燃料库存必须减少，其次，3月份是几个炼油厂进行定期维修的传统月份，因为它处于冬季需求高峰和夏季需求之间的淡季。\n考虑到北京仍在填补其战略石油储备，以及炼油企业也在促进成品油出口，中国国内的燃料消耗与中国整体原油需求也存在差异。\n这意味着，尽管一些估计显示，由于冠状病毒导致了整个城市的隔离，中国本月的燃料需求下降了高达400万桶/日，但原油进口受到的冲击可能并没有那么大。\nRefinitiv Oil Research周三发布的报告显示，预计2月份中国原油进口量为1053万桶/日，低于1月份的1069万桶/.\n仅仅下降16万桶/日对需求并没有太大的影响，如果最终的统计结果与Refinitiv的预测一致，这将使一些对中国原油需求的更为悲观的预测成为现实。\n不过，对中国石油进口的更大打击可能出现在3月份，并可能延续到4月份。\nRefinitiv的船只跟踪数据显示，136艘载有1.776亿桶原油的船只已经前往中国，预计3月份卸货，这已经超过了最近一个月平均交货量的一半。\n考虑到未来两周可能有更多货物离开中东和俄罗斯港口，3月底前仍有时间抵达中国，这一数字也远未达到最终总数。\n船舶追踪和港口数据显示，尽管中国原油进口可能比没有冠状病毒时要软，但仍保持相当好的势头，降幅远不及对国内燃料消耗的打击。\n如果中国原油进口从4月份起开始复苏，这意味着市场关注的焦点可能转移到冠状病毒对世界其他地区的影响有多大。\n随着周三在中国境外首次报告更多新病例，冠状病毒可能传播到非洲和中东的易受感染国家，甚至可能对发达国家的卫生系统造成压力的风险正在上升。\n这仍然是一个观望的方法，但如果旅行禁令和隔离措施在整个欧洲变得司空见惯，甚至对今年全球石油需求为零的预测也可能被证明是乐观的。\n然而，这一流行病，加上人们担心它可能成为一种流行病，正在推动原油价格暴跌，布伦特原油期货周四在亚洲早盘交易中跌至每桶52.57美元，创下一年来最低日内价格，并使今年1月8日见顶以来的跌幅接近27.\n假设中国真的控制住了这种病毒，并且随着刺激计划的实现，中国经济开始复苏，那么目前疲软的原油价格可能也会推动对其战略储备的购买增加",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Concerns about the coronavirus outbreak's threat to the world economy grew Saturday, even after President Donald Trump denounced criticism of his response to the threat as a \"hoax\" cooked up by his political enemies.\nChina's manufacturing plunged in February by an even wider margin than expected after efforts to contain the virus shut down much of the world's second-largest economy, an official survey showed.\nThe survey, coming as global stock markets fall sharply on fears that the virus will spread abroad, adds to mounting evidence of the vast cost of the disease that emerged in central China in December and its economic impact worldwide.\nThe list of countries touched by the virus has climbed to nearly 60, with new cases reported Saturday in Lebanon, Croatia, the Netherlands and Ecuador. More than 85,000 people worldwide have contracted the virus, with deaths topping 2,900.\nMany cases have been relatively mild, and some of those infected are believed to show no symptoms at all. But that can allow for easier spread, and concern is mounting that prolonged quarantines, supply chain disruptions and a sharp reduction in tourism and business travel could weaken the global economy or even cause a recession.\nThe monthly purchasing managers' index issued by the Chinese statistics agency and an industry group fell to 35.7 from January's 50 on a 100-point scale on which numbers below 50 indicate activity contracting.\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced a 270 billion yen ($2.5 billion) emergency economic package to help fight the virus. Abe said at a news conference that Japan is at critical juncture to determine whether the country can keep the outbreak under control ahead of the Tokyo summer Olympics.\nAbe, whose announcement this past week of a plan to close all schools for more than a month through the end of the Japanese academic year sparked public criticism, said the emergency package includes financial support for parents and their employers affected by the closures.\n\"Frankly speaking, this battle cannot be won solely by the efforts of the government,\" Abe said Saturday. \"We cannot do it without understanding and cooperation from every one of you, including medical institutions, families, companies and local governments.\"\nAs governments scrambled to control the spread and businesses wrestled with interruptions, researchers working to better understand the disease reported that the death rate may be lower than initially feared as more mild cases are counted.\nA study by Chinese researchers published Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine analyzing 1,099 patients at more than 500 hospitals throughout China calculated a death rate of 1.4%, substantially lower than earlier studies that focused on patients in Wuhan, where it started and has been most severe.\nAssuming there are many more cases with no or very mild symptoms, \"the case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1%,\" U.S. health officials wrote in an editorial in the journal.\nThat would make the new virus more like a severe seasonal flu than a disease similar to its genetic cousins SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or MERS, Middle East respiratory syndrome.\nDespite anxieties about a wider outbreak in the U.S., Trump has defended measures taken and lashed out at Democrats who have questioned his handling of the threat.\nAt a political rally Friday night in North Charleston, South Carolina, Trump asserted that Democratic complaints about his handling of the virus threat are \"their new hoax,\" echoing similar past complaints by the president about the Russia investigation and his impeachment.\nTrump accused Democrats of \"politicizing\" the coronavirus threat and boasted about preventive steps he's ordered in an attempt to keep the virus from spreading across the United States.\nShortly before Trump began to speak, health officials confirmed a second case of the virus in the U.S. in a person who didn't travel internationally or have close contact with anyone who had the virus.\nThe outbreak's spread around the globe has led to shuttered holy sites, canceled classes and changes to the daily lives of millions.\nItalian authorities say the country now has more than 1,000 coronavirus cases. The head of Italy's civil protection agency told a press conference that the total number reached 1,128 Saturday. Officials also reported eight more deaths of people with the virus, bring Italy's total to 29.\nIran is preparing for the possibility of \"tens of thousands\" of people getting tested for the virus as the number of confirmed cases spiked again Saturday, an official said, underscoring the fear both at home and abroad over the outbreak in the Islamic Republic.\nThe virus and the COVID-19 illness it causes have killed 43 people out of 593 confirmed cases in Iran, Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said. The new toll represents a jump of 205 cases - a 150% increase from the 388 reported the day before.\nEarlier Saturday, Bahrain barred public gatherings for two weeks and threatened legal prosecution against travelers who came from Iran and hadn't been tested for the virus.\nSaudi Arabia has closed off Islam's holiest sites in Mecca and Medina to foreign pilgrims, disrupting travel for thousands of Muslims already headed to the kingdom and potentially affecting plans later this year for millions more ahead of the fasting month of Ramadan and the annual hajj pilgrimage.\nEven in isolated, sanctions-hit North Korea, leader Kim Jong Un called for stronger anti-virus efforts to guard against COVID-19, saying there will be \"serious consequences\" if the illness spreads to the country.\nChina has seen a slowdown in new infections and on Saturday morning reported 427 new cases over the past 24 hours along with 47 additional deaths. The city at the epicenter of the outbreak, Wuhan, accounted for the bulk of both. The ruling party is striving to restore public and business confidence and avert a deeper economic downturn and politically risky job losses after weeks of disruptions due to the viral outbreak.\nSouth Korea, the second hardest hit country, reported 813 new cases Saturday - the highest daily jump since confirming its first patient in late January and raising its total to 3,150.\nStreets were deserted in the city of Sapporo on Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido, where a state of emergency was issued until mid-March. Seventy cases - the largest from a single prefecture in Japan - have been detected in the island prefecture.\nIn France, the archbishop of Paris advised parish priests not to administer communion by placing the sacramental bread in the mouths of worshippers. Instead, priests were told to place the bread in their hands. According to the Paris diocese, a priest tested positive for the virus Friday after returning from Italy.\nThe head of the World Health Organization on Friday announced that the risk of the virus spreading worldwide was \"very high,\" while UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the \"window of opportunity\" for containing the virus was narrowing.\nIn Asia, Tokyo Disneyland and Universal Studios Japan announced they would close, and events that were expected to attract tens of thousands of people were called off, including a concert series by the K-pop group BTS.\nTourist arrivals in Thailand are down 50% compared with a year ago, and in Italy - which has the most reported cases of any country outside of Asia - hotel bookings are falling and Premier Giuseppe Conte raised the specter of recession.\nEconomists have forecast global growth will slip to 2.4% this year, the slowest since the Great Recession in 2009, and down from earlier expectations closer to 3%. For the United States, estimates are falling to as low as 1.7% growth this year, down from 2.3% in 2019.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. public health officials said they have identified four “presumptive” coronavirus cases believed to have emerged from community transmission of the infection, signaling a turning point in efforts to contain the disease in the United States.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a statement on Friday citing three such cases newly diagnosed by state public health authorities - one each in California, Oregon and Washington state.\nIf confirmed by the CDC, together with a previous case of unknown origin announced on Wednesday in California, that would bring to four the number of diagnosed individuals in the United States with no history of travel to a country where the virus is circulating and no close contact with an infected person.\nThe three latest patients were diagnosed based on results obtained in their respective states from CDC-supplied test kits and are considered “presumptive positive” cases pending CDC confirmatory testing, the U.S. agency said.\nA fourth presumptive positive was also announced in Washington state on Friday, but that one is “likely travel-related,” the CDC said.\nStill, the three latest cases of apparent community transmission, plus the one identified earlier this week in California, are a sign the virus is now spreading within at least four separate locations up and down the U.S. West Coast.\nThey span nearly 900 miles from California’s Silicon Valley region in Santa Clara County north to the Puget Sound near Seattle.\n“What we know now is that the virus is here, present at some level, but we still don’t know to what degree,” said Dr. Sara Cody, the chief public health officer for Santa Clara County, speaking of the newly diagnosed case there, the latest of three in her county and the 10th statewide.\nEven as confirmation was pending there, the CDC sent a team to assist local authorities in tracing close contacts the patient had with others in a bid to curb transmission.\nUntil this week, the CDC had counted 15 confirmed cases in six states as having been detected through the U.S. public health system since Jan. 21, none fatal. Most were contracted by individuals while traveling in China, where the outbreak originated. Only two person-to-person transmissions were documented among them, both between married couples.\nAn additional 47 cases have been confirmed among people recently repatriated from abroad, either from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan or from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak, according to the CDC.\nThe latest flurry of cases came as the Trump administration said the United States would invoke a federal defense law to boost production of masks, gloves, gowns and other items needed to protect medical personnel from exposure.\nAround the world, more countries are reporting new infections, companies have curtailed travel and global stock markets have tumbled.\nPresident Donald Trump said at the White House on Friday the United States will decide “very soon” about whether to bar entry to travelers from countries other than China where community transmission has emerged.\nAt a rally in South Carolina on Friday night, Trump defended his administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak and accused Democrats of politicizing the disease.\n“This is their new hoax,” Trump said at the event, held a day before the state’s Democratic presidential primary.\nThe U.S. State Department has issued travel advisories for several nations and on Friday it said Americans should reconsider travel to Italy, where nearly 900 coronavirus cases have been confirmed. A similar warning was issued earlier this week for South Korea, which has hundreds of infections.\nA government task force appointed by Trump to deal with the threat will meet at the White House on Saturday morning, according to an administration official.\nLatest figures from China, where the outbreak started late last year, indicated that nearly 80,000 people have been infected, with more than 2,800 deaths. The World Health Organization reported 57 deaths in 46 other countries.\nDr. Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a closed-door briefing in the U.S. House of Representatives that sustained spread of the coronavirus meant there would be many more infections in the United States, according to a source.\nFauci warned lawmakers the country lacked enough testing resources, the source said on condition of anonymity. The CDC said it has revised its criteria for who should be tested and is ramping up testing capabilities.\n“Our goal is to have every state and local health department online and doing their own testing by the end of next week,” CDC official Nancy Messonier told reporters.\nA vaccine may take up to 18 months to develop, health officials have said.\nThe United States has decided to postpone a meeting with leaders of Southeast Asian countries it had planned to host on March 14 in Las Vegas because of worries about the outbreak.\nU.S. and global stocks plummeted as rattled investors braced for the prospect that a pandemic could further dent an already slowing world economy.\nThe S&P 500 .SPX fell for the seventh straight day on Friday, suffering its biggest weekly drop since the 2008 global financial crisis. Stocks cut losses right at the end of the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 1.4%.\nTrump this week said the coronavirus risk to Americans remained “very low,” but he has been increasingly alarmed by the reaction of the U.S. stock market, which he considers a barometer of the economy’s health.\n(GRAPHIC - Tracking the novel coronavirus: here)\n",

The rapid spread of the Coronavirus will be one of the main topics. With Italy, the country currently most affected is one of the G7. From the US, the World Health Organisation says they could become the new epicentre of the pandemic.\n\"Few states have so far been affected by the outbreak of the Coronavirus, as have the G7 states,\" said Maas der dpa. \"Those who now see the challenge this crisis poses to the G7 states, despite all the economic power and the medical know-how that has been built up, can calculate how serious the consequences can be elsewhere.\"\nHowever, a joint declaration by the G7 on the Corona crisis is unlikely to be adopted by the Foreign Ministers. According to dpa information, the group, which, in addition to the USA, Italy and Germany, also includes Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and France, could not agree on a common text in preliminary talks.\nThe differences included the term \"Wuhan virus\", which appeared in the draft submitted by the Americans. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had already used it publicly, while President Donald Trump spoke stubbornly about the \"Chinese virus\" for daysYeah. This accused him of stigmatising China in the crisis and contributing to the exclusion of Chinese people. In the meantime, Trump has moved away from the expression and is now calling for people of Asian descent not to be held responsible for the Coronavirus crisis.\nThe crisis management of the President of the United States has so far differed significantly from that of the European partner. Trump had initially tried to play down the dangers of the Coronavirus and to reassure the American population. When the US stock market collapsed in the face of the pandemic, however, he reversed and partially announced drastic measures in response to the crisis. He recently changed course again and announced that he would not shut the US down for a long time because of the Corona crisis, for fear of a recession.\nThe Corona pandemic is by no means the only subject of the G7 discussions. Foreign ministers also deal with the conflicts in Syria, Libya, Afghanistan and the Sahel. Maas recalled that these crises still needed international attention despite Corona. \"In all our actions, one thing is quite clear: the more networked and coordinated we act, the better we can tackle the many problems once the current crisis has been overcome,\" he said.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Going into the abyss of the right-wing to extreme-right US media landscape these days, it seems that their propagandists have been waiting for an event such as the Corona pandemic. Ben Shapiro, editor-in-chief of the Daily Wire and Podcaster website, warned a few days ago in his show that in the future \"every four or five years\" a virus will break out in China and therefore it would not be racist for Donald Trump to call the Coronavirus \"the Chinese virus\". A week ago, ultra-conservative radio editor Rush Limbaugh said in his broadcast:'Nothing beats the destruction of the entire US economy by a bio-threat from China, right?'\nAnd then there's Stephen Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist and former chief of the White Supremacy platform Breitbart. In his podcast War Room, which Bannon has been running since October last year, almost everything has been about Corona since the end of January, Bannon has established its own format, the title of which sounds like Action Game, War Room: Pandemic. When the epidemic began in the Chinese province of Hubei, Bannon speculated with his guests that the virus was created in a secret bioweapon program in the province capital Wuhan (this conspiracy theory is long recognized and refuted as such). Then he claimed that the World Health Organization was bought by China. In another episode, Bannon, who has been fantasizing for years about an imminent war in the South China Sea, said that China's Communist Party works with the same methods as Hitler and Goebbels.\nBannon's conspiracy theories are grotesque. He may have evolved into a political outsider after his short game in the White House and thus close to power, a clown, in fact. But that doesn't change the fact that figures like him have a million-dollar audience in the USYeah. Bannon has been invited several times in recent weeks on Trump's favorite network, Fox News. And if what New York Magazine reported in January is true, then his podcast will also be heard by White House employees. Two years after Trump threw the Bannon he later christened \"Sloppy Steve\" off his team, it almost seems as if the two of them are slowly getting closer again.\nDonald Trump is not only a broadcaster, he is more than any of his predecessors also a willing recipient of media messages. If you want to understand what Trump says when, and this is not a new insight at all, you really only have to do what Trump himself likes to do: watch Fox News. The largest news channel in the U.S. regularly raises issues that the president briefly addresses, who in turn regularly produces news (including a scarcely comprehensible amount of untruths) that Fox News quickly spreads. They both need each other. Both also need constant hostility in order to keep their own voters or spectators in the mood.\nAt first glance, it seems that this symbiotic relationship has continued as usual in the past few weeks of the emerging and now seemingly unbridled Corona crisis in the United States. Trump initially denied, synchronised with the on-air statements of most Fox News moderators, the dangers of the Coronavirus and accused the political opponent, the Democratic Party, once again of conspiring against him and the country. After the Mueller investigation, under the impeachment procedure, Corona should now be the next alleged hoax, the next fictional story to bring down the president and his alleged achievements.\nThroughout March, however, Trump's rhetoric changed again in line with that of his home networkYeah. The tone became temporarily more cautious, sometimes even presidential in the traditional sense. Until Donald Trump lost his patience a few days ago, he seems to be taking too long with this virus: After Easter, in the middle of April, the country had to be \"opened\" again, Trump demanded (and was offered the stage by Fox News). The President seems to want to see the initial restrictions that are now in force in large parts of the United States lifted. The economic engine is to be applied, from zero to hundreds, by cold start. Trump, who has explained the state of the US stock indices as the measure of his political action, cannot use a recession. Not a few months before the presidential election.\nTrump is, as the last few weeks have confirmed impressively, primarily about one thing: his re-election in November. In short, it seemed as if he had at least lost the power of interpretation over this crisis, that his administration had allowed important weeks, indeed almost two months, to pass without developing a federal strategy of prevention against the spread of the Coronavirus, is obvious. The point now is to at least keep the spin on the crisis, to determine the story. Since Trump has positioned himself as a strong leader in the daily Corona press conferences in the White House, his popularity has increased again. Trump's approval ratings are up to 49 per cent, which are surprisingly high given his administration's manifestly poor crisis management.\nConsidering the past three months since the news of the Corona outbreak in the Chinese province of Wuhan, one thing in political-media America this time was different than usual. There was a high-quality Fox News moderator who crashed on the Corona issue much earlier than the othersYeah. In January, when his colleagues, the President and most of the competitors were still mainly engaged in the Impeachment process, Tucker Carlson sounded the alarm about Corona. Carlson sends to Prime Time every night at 20-o'clock and is one of the most influential mood makers in the country.\nWhat was even more remarkable was that Carlson had already found a culprit before the massive spread of Covid-19 infections in the US had even begun. Carlson blamed \"Chinese culture\" when Trump tweeted to Chinese President Xi Jinping thanking him for his treatment of the virus. In a way, Carlson was \"trumpeter than trump\", as Vanity Fair put it a few days ago: Carlson saw an opportunity in the virus, but a racist one. He thus laid the foundations for what has been increasingly seen in the US since then: the right instrumentalisation of the pandemic.\nThe fact that Trump, who spoke at the end of February about the number of infected in the US being close to zero, now sees his country in a \"war\" against the \"Chinese virus\" and sees itself as \"President in wartime\" is also obviously due to Tucker Carlson decided to make an extraordinary intervention in early March. After observing Trump's blatant denial of the mounting Corona crisis for weeks, the moderator travelled on the 7th. March to Florida to convince Trump there, in his private club Mar-a-Lago, himself of the seriousness of the situation. He felt a \"moral obligation,\" Carlson later said in an interview. It was said that the conversation between the two men lasted two hours. Apparently effective. A lot of what Trump's been doing since then follows Carlson's script.\nThis is: finding a simple story for a complex situatioYeah. More than three million Americans have already lost their jobs over the past two weeks as a result of the actual freezing of the US economy, the country is moving towards a recession, hospitals in particularly affected major cities such as New York City and Seattle have long been overloaded. Trump is now trying to find answers as well as distractions. The direction is becoming more and more marked: protecting the national borders even harder; emphasising even more strongly the supposed enemies of the country; appealing even more strongly to American patriotism and exceptionalism; praising even more fiercely the domestic economy, and at the same time warning of its demise.\nIn short, Trump will probably be even more Trump. And the right media will help him, especially Fox News.\nThe character Tucker Carlson is not only interesting to understand Trump's change of tactics. Carlson's daily program also shows how panic production works. In the monologues held by the 50-year-old at the beginning of each broadcast, he reliably condemns everything that is somehow left: basic consent to immigration, feminism, climate protection, political correctness, globalism, diversity. His occasional advice is also against Republicans. Carlson likes to stage himself as an outraged loudspeaker of the simple worker. But the supposed opposition to the establishment, like Trump, ultimately serves only to play off the chauvinistic part of white America against minorities and immigrants.\nAlready on the first show Carlson reported the Corona virus on 23rd. In January, he made it clear what message should be sent to his viewers from now on.\" I know we have to pretend that all cultures and all behaviour are the same,\"Carlson said, but that is not the case\" The abuse of animals, the eating of koalas and snakes and bats and dogs, that is apparently common in this town, Wuhan,\"he continued.\nWhat Tucker Carlson hammered into his millions of viewers on a daily basis over the next two months can be condensed to this story, which he told on his show on 6th. March summed up, one day before his trip to Florida: communist China first took control of the global pharmaceutical business, then released a virus into the world, and because liberal media and left activists in the US were more important anti-racism and identity policy than secure borders, Many people would have to die now. It is not climate change that is the most existential threat in the United States, but the alleged dependence on China.\" The people who told us that life in a limitless world does not bring any disadvantages have lied,\"said the moderator.\"It's not that simple. Trump was right about everything: trade, immigration, production, globalization.\"Carlson's message was unequivocal: The Corona crisis was a chance to finally implement Trump's slogan\"Make America great again\".\nThe message seems to have arrived.\" I think we've learned a lot. We've learned a lot. This crisis has made it clear how important it is to have strong borders and a robust production sector,\"Trump said at a press conference the other day. A few days earlier, his staff had sent an e-mail to Trump supporters saying that the US was \"attacked not only by an invisible virus, but also by the Chinese\". The fact that the number of attacks on Americans of Asian origin has increased sharply in recent weeks is likely to be a direct consequence of this propaganda.\" I have never felt this way in my 27-year-old life in this country,\"Jiayang Fan, a New Yorker author, tweeted in mid-MarcYeah.\nOne thing you can't blame Trump for after more than three years in the White House is that he's hard to read. Sometimes he follows his impulses, sometimes he follows Fox News. He knows no shame, he does not care about contradictions in content. But the main thing is always to assert his power. In this respect, it is remarkably transparent.\nAs far as the Corona narrative is concerned, the President and the right-wing media seem to have clearly agreed. The narrative is war.\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that this is not just rhetorical. I got 26. In March, The Nation Magazine announced that the Washington government would send additional 1.500 soldiers to the Mexican and Canadian borders. While cities like New York have been waiting for support from Washington for weeks, the government is arming the already over-militarized border.\n\"I am a president at war,\" Trump said at a press conference a few days ago. He said, \"This is a war. A different kind of war than we ever had.",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "这些天，美国媒体从右翼到极右翼的格局陷入深渊，似乎他们的宣传人员一直在等待科罗纳大流行这样的事件。《每日电讯报》和播客网站主编本夏皮罗（Ben Shapiro）几天前在节目中警告说，未来“每四五年”一次病毒将在中国爆发，因此唐纳德·特朗普称冠状病毒为“中国病毒”不会是种族主义。一周前，极端保守的电台编辑拉什林堡（Rush Limbaugh）在他的广播中说：“没有什么比中国的生物威胁摧毁整个美国经济更好的了，对吧？”\n还有斯蒂芬·班农，特朗普的前首席策略师和白人至上平台前首席布瑞巴特。从去年10月开始，班农就开始运营他的播客《战争室》，从1月底开始，几乎所有关于科罗纳的事情都是这样，班农已经建立了自己的格式，名字听起来像是动作游戏《战争室：大流行》。当这种病毒在中国湖北省开始流行时，班农和他的客人们猜测，这种病毒是在省会武汉的一个秘密生物武器项目中产生的（这种阴谋论早就得到了承认和驳斥）。然后他声称世界卫生组织是中国收购的。在另一集中，多年来一直幻想南中国海即将爆发战争的班农说，中国共产党的工作方法与希特勒和戈培尔一样。\n班农的阴谋论很荒谬。他在白宫短暂的游戏之后，可能已经演变成了一个政治局外人，从而接近权力，实际上是一个小丑。但这并不能改变像他这样的人物在美国拥有百万美元观众的事实是 啊。最近几周，班农在特朗普最喜欢的网络福克斯新闻（Fox News）上多次受到邀请。如果1月份纽约杂志的报道是真的，那么他的播客也会被白宫员工听到。在特朗普把他后来命名为“邋遢的史蒂夫”的班农扔出他的团队两年后，他们两人似乎又慢慢接近了。\n唐纳德·特朗普不仅是一名广播员，他比任何前任都更愿意接受媒体信息。如果你想了解特朗普什么时候说什么，而这根本不是什么新的见解，你真的只需要做特朗普自己喜欢做的事情：看福克斯新闻。美国最大的新闻频道经常会引发总统简短讲话的问题，而总统又经常制造福克斯新闻迅速传播的新闻（包括难以理解的大量不实信息）。他们都需要对方。双方都需要持续的敌意，以保持自己的选民或观众的情绪。\n乍一看，这种共生关系似乎在过去的几周里一直像往常一样，在美国出现了现在看来肆无忌惮的日冕危机。特朗普最初否认了冠状病毒的危险性，与大多数福克斯新闻主持人的广播讲话同步，并指责政治对手民主党再次密谋反对他和国家。经过穆勒的调查，根据弹劾程序，科罗纳现在应该是下一个所谓的骗局，下一个虚构的故事，以推翻总统和他所谓的成就。\n然而，在整个3月，特朗普的言辞再次发生变化，与他的家庭网络一致是 啊。这种语气暂时变得更加谨慎，有时甚至是传统意义上的总统。在唐纳德·特朗普几天前失去耐心之前，他似乎对这种病毒花了太长时间：在4月中旬的复活节之后，特朗普要求国家必须再次“开放”（并由福克斯新闻台提供舞台）。奥巴马总统似乎希望看到美国大部分地区现行的最初限制措施被取消。经济型发动机将采用冷起动方式，从零到数百。特朗普将美国股指的状况解释为其政治行动的衡量标准，他不能利用衰退。就在总统选举前几个月。\n正如过去几周令人印象深刻地证实的那样，特朗普主要关注一件事：他在11月的连任。简而言之，他似乎至少失去了对这场危机的解释能力，他的政府在没有制定联邦防止冠状病毒传播战略的情况下，让重要的几周，甚至几乎两个月过去，这是显而易见的。现在的关键是，至少要继续关注危机，以确定事件的来龙去脉。自从特朗普在白宫每日的科罗纳记者会上把自己定位为强有力的领袖以来，他的支持率再次上升。特朗普的支持率高达49%，鉴于其政府明显的危机管理不善，支持率高得惊人。\n考虑到中国武汉发生日冕爆发的消息过去三个月，美国政治媒体这次有一件事与以往不同。有一位高质量的福克斯新闻主持人在科罗纳问题上比其他主持人早得多是 啊。今年1月，当他的同事、总统和大多数竞争对手仍主要参与弹劾程序时，塔克卡尔森敲响了科罗纳的警钟。卡尔森每晚20点都会在黄金时段上班，是美国最有影响力的情绪制造者之一。\n更值得注意的是，在Covid-19病毒在美国的大规模传播还没有开始之前，卡尔森就已经找到了罪魁祸首。卡尔森指责特朗普在推特上向中国国家主席习近平感谢他对病毒的治疗时“中国文化”。在某种程度上，卡尔森是“吹号者胜于特朗普”，正如《名利场》几天前所说：卡尔森在病毒中看到了一个机会，但却是一个种族主义者。因此，他为自那时以来在美国越来越普遍的现象奠定了基础：正确地将大流行工具化。\n特朗普今年2月底曾谈到美国感染人数接近零，现在他认为自己的国家正在与“中国病毒”进行“战争”，并将自己视为“战时总统”，这显然也是由于塔克卡尔森决定在3月初进行一次特别干预。在观察了特朗普几周来公然否认日益加剧的科罗纳危机之后，主持人于7日出访。前往佛罗里达说服特朗普，在他的私人俱乐部马拉格，他自己的情况的严重性。卡尔森后来在接受采访时说，他感到有“道德义务”。据说这两个人的谈话持续了两个小时。显然有效。特朗普从那以后做的很多事情都遵循卡尔森的剧本。\n这是：为复杂的情况寻找一个简单的故是 啊。过去两周，由于美国经济的实际冻结，已经有300多万美国人失业，美国正走向衰退，纽约市和西雅图等受影响特别严重的大城市的医院长期超载。特朗普现在试图找到答案，同时也分心。这个方向变得越来越明显：更加努力地保护国家边界；更加强烈地强调国家的假想敌人；更加强烈地呼吁美国的爱国主义和例外主义；更加猛烈地赞扬国内经济，同时警告其灭亡。\n简言之，特朗普可能会更为特朗普。合适的媒体会帮助他，尤其是福克斯新闻。\n角色塔克·卡尔森（Tucker Carlson）不仅对理解特朗普改变策略很有兴趣。卡尔森的每日节目也展示了恐慌生产是如何运作的。在每一次广播开始时，这位50岁的年轻人的独白中，他可靠地谴责了一切以某种方式留下的东西：对移民的基本同意、女权主义、气候保护、政治正确性、全球化、多样性。他偶尔的建议也是反对共和党的。卡尔森喜欢把自己装扮成一个愤怒的普通工人的扩音器。但是，像特朗普一样，所谓的对建制派的反对，最终只会起到淡化美国白人对少数民族和移民沙文主义的作用。\n卡尔森已经在23日的第一场节目中报道了冠状病毒。今年1月，他明确表示，今后应该向观众传达什么信息。”我知道我们必须假装所有的文化和行为都是一样的，”卡尔森说，但事实并非如此\"虐待动物，吃考拉、蛇、蝙蝠和狗，这在武汉这个小镇显然很普遍，”他接着说。\n塔克·卡尔森在接下来的两个月里每天给数百万观众带来的冲击可以浓缩为这个故事，他在6日的节目中讲述了这个故事。马奇在佛罗里达之行的前一天总结道：共产主义中国首先控制了全球制药业务，然后向世界释放了一种病毒，而且由于自由媒体和美国左翼活动分子的反种族主义和身份政策比安全边界更重要，现在很多人都要死了。美国面临的最大威胁不是气候变化，而是所谓的对中国的依赖。”主持人说：“那些告诉我们生活在一个无限的世界里不会带来任何不利条件的人都撒了谎，并不是那么简单。特朗普在贸易、移民、生产、全球化等所有方面都是正确的。“卡尔森的信息是明确的：科罗纳危机是最终落实特朗普“让美国再次伟大”口号的机会。\n信息似乎已经到达。”我想我们学到了很多。我们学到了很多。这场危机清楚表明，拥有强大的边界和强大的生产部门是多么重要，”特朗普前几天在记者招待会上说。几天前，他的幕僚曾给特朗普的支持者发过一封电子邮件，称美国“不仅受到隐形病毒的攻击，还受到中国人的攻击”。最近几周，针对亚裔美国人的袭击事件急剧增加，这很可能是这种宣传的直接后果。”在我27岁的国家生活中，我从未有过这样的感是 啊。\n有一件事你不能怪特朗普在白宫呆了三年多，那就是他很难读懂。有时他跟随他的冲动，有时他跟随福克斯新闻。他不知道羞耻，他不在乎内容上的矛盾。但最重要的是始终坚持他的权力。在这方面，它是非常透明的。\n至于科罗纳的说法，总统和右翼媒体似乎已经明确同意。故事是战争。\n越来越清楚的是，这不仅仅是修辞。我得了26分。今年3月，《国家》杂志宣布，华盛顿政府将向墨西哥和加拿大边境增派1500名士兵。虽然像纽约这样的城市已经等了华盛顿几个星期的支持，但政府正在武装已经过度军事化的边境。\n特朗普几天前在记者招待会上说：“我是一名参战总统。他说：“这是一场战争。一场不同于以往的战争。",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The Covid-19 epidemic in China seems to be contained for once. But how does the government intend to stop the economic collapse? What about the credibility of the regime? How does the device work and why did it fail after the virus broke out? These questions and more are answered by Sebastian Heilmann, professor at the University of Trier and former director of the Berlin think tank Merics.\nONLINE TIME: China's government is now gradually lifting the quarantine of Wuhan and Hubei and for a week now the leadership in Beijing has declared that there are no new infections in the country. They just came in from abroad. No more Sars-CoV-2 cases in China after the official confirmation of 800.000 infections since January, can this be?\nSebastian Heilmann: It is a decision of the Politburo that the epidemic is over. Of course, the virus is not gone, but there must be no more negative messages. We have evidence that the epidemic has been contained. However, there is unofficial information that there are still cases in Southwest China that are suspected of Covid-19. The risk of a new infection wave therefore remains concrete for China. What we are seeing now is, above all, a political approach. All unpleasant information is suppressed, and the propaganda apparatus formulates the most important story in the end itself: that the epidemic has been defeated thanks to the superiority of China's system.\nONLINE TIME: A key reason for lifting restrictions in society and the economy is the bad economic climate. The lockdown broke China's economy in the first quarter. How does the Beijing leadership want to tackle the economic crisis? Europe and the USA are the main markets for China because of the virusYeah.\nHeilmann: China's economy, according to what we can sum up from various sources, is again at about 80 percent of its performance. But there is a real catch-up in China. The great unknown is now the demand. We have a global break-in that affects China's exports and supply chains and is hardly countervailable. Domestic demand is also uncertain: are people buying cars or 5G phones again to the extent expected before the crisis? Beijing will now have to save companies with its state banks, especially in the private sector, where liquidity is very tight and with minimal margins. Many small and medium-sized enterprises are on the brink.\nONLINE TIME: Will China spend as much money on this as 2009 did in the financial crisis?\nHeilmann: So far, the Chinese government has been reluctant, in flagrant contrast to the US and the major European economies, which are actually flown with support programmes. China had imposed on 2009 a huge incentive programme of 17% of gross domestic product, which also boosted demand strongly worldwide, but caused serious distortions in investment behaviour in China. Similar programmes have not yet been identified in China. Foreign projects such as the New Silk Road will also have to cope with significantly less funding in the coming years.\nONLINE TIME: Will China invest less abroad in the future?\nNot necessarily. We must expect Chinese investors to make targeted advances against companies and industries that have been closed to them so far. Crisis-related prices would be favourable for investments and acquisitions in Europe. I can imagine that many small and medium-sized businesses in Germany, to whom the economic recession is adding, are quite willing to sell. This is expected to become an increasingly important issue in the coming weeksYeah.\nTIME ONLINE: Party leader Xi Jinping now sends solidarity addresses to other countries, state and companies donate and sell medical supplies abroad, including to Europe, for example in hard-hit Italy. It may be suspected that this is not entirely unhelpful, that Beijing not only wants to improve its geopolitical position towards the Washington government, but is also seeking goodwill so that as many European states as possible, for example, choose to do so, engage latent spy suspect 5G network equipment Huawei. Is that right?\nHeilmann: Beijing is clearly about opening doors in Europe. And let us not delude ourselves: international investment is, of course, welcome in crisis-ridden European economies. China continues to invest heavily in 5G, and from there companies will come to us and say:'We will build you the infrastructure and bring the funding right away'; some governments will not be able to resist.\nTIME ONLINE: Can something be done about the sale of companies?\nHeilmann: The EU and national governments want to prevent a sale out in times of crisis, if necessary through state participation in companies. But I would suggest a more offensive strategy towards Beijing: \"You are helping us now, selling and giving us medical aid, which we appreciate, but we want a moratorium as a confidence-building measure, that, during this crisis phase, no European companies are acquired using Chinese state banks or other state funding models.\"\nI think this is a viable path. The Chinese government will be open to such a proposal, because the rabid acquisition campaigns of American investors in crisis-ridden Asian economies, such as the Asia crisis between 1997 and 1999, are repeatedly criticized harshly in ChinaYeah. Chinese investors do not want to be seen as hedgehogs.\nONLINE TIME: It is a thin line between the resurgence of Covid-19 infections and the stimulation of the economy. How does China intend to strengthen domestic demand?\nHeilmann: With the aim of economic stimulus and social compensation, China's government is expected to introduce generous tax relief up to coupon programs so that even those on low incomes can participate in economic recovery through their consumption. I also believe that targeted purchase subsidies for cars or the badly indebted real estate sector are well possible.\nTIME ONLINE: Is there anything known about widespread dissatisfaction in the population due to the virus crisis?\nHeilmann: Dissatisfaction is regularly articulated in social media. However, as I see it, the monitoring methods have been tightened up and modernised to such an extent that no protest can be organised at the moment. In the course of the fight against the epidemic in China, we see a dramatic increase in the pooled analysis of location data, facial recognition and behavioural profiles. This epidemic has dramatically accelerated the expansion of digital surveillance in China. The control apps developed to combat the epidemic will be introduced in an adapted form in Chinese everyday life.\nONLINE TIME: What is the current status of the regime in the Chinese population?\nHeilmann: Compared to the disastrous epidemic in Italy or the USA, there are now many positive, system-supporting statements. They are generated on the one hand by propaganda, but there is also a lot of spontaneous support. A kind of live system comparison is currently taking place in front of all of us: which country is coping well with the pandemic? Chinese look to South Korea, Japan, also Italy, but especially to the USYeah. They see that the US may not have been able to cope with this epidemic and may be badly damaged economically and politically. And that, paradoxically, China's global status is being promoted by the pandemic, which originated from China but fought successfully there.\nTIME ONLINE: Does the KP leadership also interpret their handling of the epidemic as superiority of the authoritarian one-party system?\nHeilmann: The KP has grown up as a campaign party, it has won the revolution 1949 through mass mobilization and coercion. Since then, the KP has resorted to campaigns in every crisis situation. This kind of emergency mobilization is in the DNA of this party. The party headquarters can switch to crisis mode within a very short period of time, push aside bureaucratic rules and apparatus and drive huge waves of pressure through the entire system that no one can resist. Hard collective disciplinary measures such as the recent outbreak of the epidemic are the natural playing field for the KP.\nTIME ONLINE: There have recently been disinformation campaigns based on official Chinese authorities and partisan media: Suggestions that the virus did not come from Wuhan, that US soldiers had brought it to China or that it came from Italy. Such campaigns against other governments seldom come from Beijing. Why now?\nHeilmann: Chinese disinformation campaigns have been more frequent recently, for example in the Xinjiang question, against Taiwan or Hong Kong, most recently also against Sweden, i.e. smaller political players. But now we are seeing a global campaign aimed at changing the Corona story. China is responsible in two ways from the Western perspective. On the one hand, the initial phase was overslept and early warnings from Chinese doctors were suppressed, which made the pandemic only possibleYeah. And Beijing has allowed hundreds of thousands of Chinese to travel abroad in the last January Ridge. China therefore has a central role and responsibility as the starting point of the pandemic. But this storyline is harmful from the point of view of the Communist Party; it must be changed for the benefit of China.\nONLINE TIME: But the seriousness of the Chinese leadership, at least in Western countries, suffers with the spread of Hanover conspiracy theories.\nHeilmann: China's KP likes to see itself as the guardian of scientific evidence and expertise, especially in contrast to the Trump government, but also in contrast to Russian disinformation and destabilisation campaigns. I therefore think that the KP propaganda will backfire. The conspiracy theory about an American origin of the virus can be interpreted more as a test balloon of foreign policy hawks in Beijing. The party leadership is not aiming for confrontation, but for the country to be willing and helpful internationally in the Corona crisis and not irresponsible and manipulative.\nONLINE TIME: Does China's propaganda actually tell its people the same stories about the origin of the virus?\nHeilmann: Debt assignments to the US, which at the same time deflect responsibility from China, spread quickly in China's social media, because they meet the national pride of many. On the other hand, despite censorship and propaganda, most Chinese are far too clever not to recognize such simple distractions. Many are simply skeptical of official statements about the Coronavirus, because they were personally affected by this epidemic and were able to make their own observations. I expect that the story of a mysterious foreign origin of the virus will therefore not come trueYeah.\nONLINE TIME: The outbreak of the Coronavirus showed that the KP leadership was not informed about everything. The epidemic represents exactly the opposite of what the party stands for: it carries the risk of social unrest and shows that, despite the lessons learned from the Sars crisis 2003, no action was taken on the basis of scientific criteria. How could it have come to this?\nHeilmann: The KP elite in the closed party and government center Zhongnanhai in Beijing employs loyal officials and experts who receive many messages that others will never see and who filter and evaluate them for the KP leadership. These are very serious and highly trained forces, analytically sharp, strategically thinking.\nBut they are by no means risk-averse, which is typical of a highly centralised, authoritarian system such as the Chinese one. The hierarchy of officials has the greatest difficulty in passing on unpleasant or even catastrophic information, which has to be carried from bottom to top of many levels in the KP hierarchy, from the local level to the centre. This system is based on so many information filters that politically undesirable findings make it difficult to get to headquarters in time. We can see from this that freedom of information and freedom of the press is a really good thing.\nONLINE TIME: Will party leader Xi Jinping and his ruling KP rather weaken or emerge stronger from the Corona disaster?\nHeilmann: Unless there are new waves of infection in China and chaotic conditions in the USA, Xi and the KP will definitely emerge from the pandemic. If the American economy and the US dollar are seriously damaged as a result of the pandemic, then China will emerge as a winner from the system comparisoYeah.

        "news_content_translate_en": "No country after China was as badly affected by the spread of the new Coronavirus as South Korea. More than 7.700 cases were with booth from Tuesday. But it seems that the spread has been controlled: there are now far fewer new infections than there were ten days ago. Taiwan, the country many thought would be particularly hard hit by the spread because of its close economic ties with China, also has the problem under control. In Japan, which also maintains close economic relations with the People's Republic, one of the most recent infected was 1.200, with more than 126 million inhabitants. All three states are democracies, unlike the PRC, where the virus broke out. The head of the World Health Organisation (WHO) personally praised the city state of Singapore, which is a largely free country despite some very authoritarian moves, because contacts there would be particularly efficiently tracked. What can Europe learn from these countries with its steadily increasing numbers of new infections? Our Asian correspondents report.\nIn South Korea, Wednesday began with an epidemiological nightmare. Particularly in the metropolis of Seoul, where ten million people live, around a call center 90 people infected with the novel Coronavirus. Nearby: a commuter station connecting the suburbs to the centre. Across the country, health authorities 242 reported new infections that day.\nDespite the increase, the East Asian state has had considerable success in the fight against the virus. In March more than 900 people infected, there were only 131 new infections on TuesdaSouth Korea may have unfavourable conditions to deal with such an epidemic: on the one hand, geographical and economic proximity to China would have favoured imported cases especially at the beginning of the outbreak. On the other hand, South Korea is one of the most densely populated countries in the world outside the city states, and the population density in Seoul is four times as high as in Berlin.\nIn addition, more than two thirds of all cases in South Korea are related to a single chain of infections. When it emerged in February that a woman who is a member of a sect carrying the virus was tested almost all of the more than 10.000 members of the Shincheonji sect in the city of Daegu. Result: Good 4.000 people carried the virus. That's more than half the cases of 7.700 Coronavirus all over the country.\nNevertheless, South Korea has managed to reverse the rapid outbreak without long-term quarantines and without a ban on foreign entry. Only visitors from the South China province of Hubei must be quarantined for a 14-day period.\nHardly a country in the world has systematically tested its population for the Coronavirus. With stand of ten. In March, more than 220.000 South Koreans were tested for the pathogen in a 50-million population. Comparison: The US has only carried out nearly 10.000 tests with more than six times the population of South Korea. Looking at these two figures, it reflects what constitutes a good and bad response to the virus,\"US epidemiologist Larry Brilliant commented in a BBC interview.\nAccording to the Seoul Ministry of Health, the tests are free of charge for the population. And conveniently: As the first country, South Korea has introduced so-called drive-through test stations on many busy roads. In provisional tents, doctors conduct a test in less than ten minuteYeah. The driver doesn't even have to leave his car for that. More than fifty such drive-throughs are in operation nationwide.\nThe sale of face masks in pharmacies is limited to two per person. The export of masks abroad is long forbidden.\nIn addition, South Korea is pushing for radical transparency in the fight against the virus, which would probably not be compatible with data protection and privacy in Germany: in cooperation with telecommunication providers, the authorities are sending warning SMS to residents of risk areas on their phones, The movements of the infected were also published in detail.\nFabian Kretschmer, Beijing,\nIn Taiwan, the world is still almost in order, at least in terms of Covid-19. Only 49 people have been infected, one person has died. Overall, this is a remarkable balance sheet for a country with 23 million inhabitants, located directly off the coast of China. Not even a large dark figure can be feared in view of the well-developed health system.\nOf course, concern about the virus has also reached the island state. Restaurants are less crowded, more people wear mouthpieces and events fall out. But on the whole, everyday life goes on as normal. This has to do with bad experiences from the past and with current good preparation. After 73 Sars deaths, the 2003 government designed an effective system against epidemics that responded early. From 31st. In December 2019, after first reports of suspected diseases, officials already checked passengers from the Chinese city of Wuhan before leaving the plane. And three days before China on 23rd. January Wuhan sealed off, Taiwan already activated its crisis center. One day later, the export of protective masks was prohibited, on the 6th. In February the entry of all Chinese citizens stopped, no matter wherYeah.\nAuthorities have been able to read infection chains almost without gaps and quarantine contact persons. This also applies to people who have been in high-risk areas. At the end of February, 30.000 people were in isolation or were behind them. Daily visits and calls ensure that no one leaves their apartment for 14-day periods. Draconian punishments are also accepted in the democratic constitutional state of Taiwan. A returned from China who, instead of staying at home, drove across the country, was sentenced at the beginning of March to the maximum penalty of 30.000 euros.\n15.000 people have already been tested, the capacities are sufficient for more than 3.000 tests daily. This, combined with transparent communication, has increased the popularity of the government. It is also helpful that the Vice President is a renowned epidemiologist who, as Minister of Health, had already led the fight against Sars.\nTaiwan has little support from the World Health Organisation, and the island state must not even be a member of the WTO under pressure from China. The People's Republic considers Taiwan to be part of its territory and is therefore excluded from all UN organisations. Attendance at expert meetings and access to databases are prohibited for Taiwanese disease control officers. China remains tough, even though Europeans, Americans and Japanese argue behind the scenes for Taiwan's involvement in the WTO network.\nWhen researchers from Taiwan's National Academy of Sciences reported a few days ago that their newly developed SARS-CoV-2 rapid test could prove within fifteen minutes, it did not take long for Chinese state media to perceive this as their country's success. It may take months to verify that the new method is reliable. It cannot be denied, however, that Taiwan is contributing to the fight against the virus.\nKlaus Bardenhagen, Taipei\nIn Singapore, Mr H threatenYeah. six months imprisonment or a penalty of several thousand euros. The 38-year-old recently survived a Covid-19 disease. But after the recovery, the authorities contacted him. They accuse him and his wife of violating the Infectious Disease Act. The alleged crime of the two: they allegedly gave false information about where they had been in the days before the diagnosis.\nOn the charge against the two informed Singapore Ministry of Health journalists through a press release, he also named the full names of the accused and issued a warning to the public: those who lie during the surveys by the disease fighters commit a serious crime.\nThe city state is well known for strict rules of conduct and penile surveillance, and now this approach also indicates the direction in the containment of the new Coronavirus. The authorities have been successful so far: researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston are assuming in a new study that Singapore is three times better able to detect infections than on the global average.\nAt the heart of Singapore's strategy is the so-called contact tracking, i.e. the search for contacts of Covid-19 patients. Employees of the health authorities shall draw up, on the basis of a consultation of the persons concerned, a complete record of their whereabouts over the past two weeks. If someone can't remember exactly where he was with who, the police are used for further investigation. Officials then evaluate surveillance cameras, for example, to find out which taxi driver was travelling with an infected person.\nThe authorities were able to trace all local infections to six clusters and to stop the spread. And of course, anyone who had close contact with a Covid-19 patient must be quarantined in SingaporeYeah.\nViolations of quarantine regulations can also have serious consequences: a 45-year-old foreigner who had a permanent residence permit in Singapore has been declared an undesirable person in the city state. After a visit to China, he had failed to comply with the requirement to stay in his apartment for a 14-day period. The man therefore loses his home.\" Some people think this is too harsh,\"Minister of the Interior Kasiviswanathan Shanmugam wrote on Facebook. At this time, however, it is necessary for everyone to cooperate.\"\nResistance among the population to the harsh course of government has not yet been felt. There is praise from health experts: the head of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, recommended to look away from the city state: \"I am really impressed with Singapore's efforts to find any case, follow up contacts and stop the transmission.\"\nMathias Peer, Bangkok,\nWhen Prime Minister Shinzo Abe appeared before the press in Japan at the end of February, he had one request: all schools in the country should close for two weeks. Events with large crowds of people are cancelled or at least moved to avoid infections. Prior to this, the Japanese Ministry of Economy had already advised companies in the country to have their staff trained by the home office. And citizens like to avoid the daily rush hour, as well as shopping centers and other places typical of collections.\nThis consistent line from the official side was introduced when the 900-infections were counted in Japan. Also included were about 700-persons on the cruise ship Diamond Princess. It was precisely because of this ship that the government was strongly criticised. After the first case of infection on board had become known at the beginning of February, quarantine facilities remained rather vague for more than two weeksYeah. On board there were no clear commands for changing protective clothing, crew members sometimes acted more freely than passengers and thus became infected. When the Diamond Princess was finally gradually evacuated, passengers without symptoms were initially sent home even in public transport.\nThere was a big scream. The Japanese government was once again as careless as 2011 when it experienced Fukushima's nuclear gau, it was said. Since then, Prime Minister Abe has been particularly present. At the end of February, when the northern island of Hokkaido imposed a regional state of emergency with de facto curfew, Abe had already begun to prepare the whole of Japan for such a step.\nLast Tuesday, his government finally initiated an amendment to a law, which will also apply to Covid-19 cases. At the end of this week, it will probably happen in both chambers. Then Abe can no longer only recommend school closures and event cancellations, but also give instructions. In order to avoid not only domestic transport, but also new imports of the virus, Japan is currently not granting entry to people from South Korea, Iran or northern Italy.\nIt's hard to tell how effective the whole thing is now. The rate of growth of total infections does not seem to be exponential but rather linear at the moment. Recently, Japan, including the passengers on the Diamond Princess, counted around 1.200 Corona cases with 126 million residents. In addition, doctors have reported that, due to various precautions, flu infections are currently less common than usual.

        "news_content_translate_cn": "在中国之后，没有一个国家像韩国那样受到新冠状病毒传播的严重影响。从星期二起，布思的案子就超过了7700件。但似乎传播已经得到控制：现在的新感染病例比十天前少得多。许多人认为，由于台湾与中国的经济关系密切，这种扩散会对台湾造成特别严重的打击，台湾的问题也已得到控制。在与中华人民共和国保持密切经济关系的日本，最近感染者中有1200人，居民超过1.26亿。这三个州都是民主国家，不像病毒爆发的中华人民共和国。世界卫生组织（世卫组织）主席亲自赞扬新加坡这个城市国家，尽管采取了一些非常专制的行动，但新加坡基本上是一个自由的国家，因为那里的接触将得到特别有效的跟踪。随着新感染病例的不断增加，欧洲能从这些国家学到什么？我们的亚洲记者报道。\n在韩国，周三开始的是一场流行病噩梦。尤其是在首尔这座拥有1000万人口的大都市，一个呼叫中心周围有90人感染了新型冠状病毒。附近：连接郊区和市中心的通勤站。在全国范围内，卫生当局242日报告了当天的新感染病例。\n尽管有所增加，这个东亚国家在抗击病毒方面取得了相当大的成功。三月份有900多人感染，周二只有131人新感韩国可能有不利的条件来应对这一流行病：一方面，与中国的地理和经济邻近将有利于进口病例，特别是在疫情爆发之初。另一方面，韩国是世界上除城邦以外人口最稠密的国家之一，首尔的人口密度是柏林的四倍。\n此外，在韩国，超过三分之二的病例与单一的感染链有关。今年2月有消息称，大邱市的新千教成员中，几乎所有人都接受了一名携带病毒的教派成员女性的检测。结果：4000人携带病毒。这是全国7700个冠状病毒病例的一半以上。\n尽管如此，韩国在没有长期隔离和禁止外国入境的情况下，成功扭转了疫情的快速爆发。只有来自中国南方湖北省的游客必须被隔离14天。\n世界上几乎没有一个国家对其人口进行过系统的冠状病毒检测。十号位。今年3月，在5000万韩国人中，超过22万韩国人接受了病原体检测。比较：美国只进行了近1万次检测，检测人数是韩国的6倍多。美国流行病学家拉里·布莱恩特（Larry Brilliant）在接受英国广播公司（BBC）采访时评论说：“看看这两个数字，它反映出对病毒的反应是好是坏。\n据首尔卫生部称，这些检测对民众是免费的。而且方便：作为第一个国家，韩国已经在许多繁忙的道路上引入了所谓的直通测试站。在临时帐篷里，医生在不到十分钟的时间里做了一次检是 啊。司机甚至不用离开他的车。在全国范围内有50多个这样的直通车在运营。\n药店的口罩销售限制在每人两个。口罩出口到国外早就被禁止了。\n此外，韩国正在推动彻底透明地打击该病毒，这可能与德国的数据保护和隐私不兼容：当局与电信供应商合作，通过手机向危险地区居民发送警告短信，还详细公布了感染者的行踪。\n法比安克雷奇默，北京，\n在台湾，至少就Covid-19而言，世界几乎仍然井然有序。只有49人被感染，1人死亡。总的来说，对于一个拥有2300万居民的国家来说，这是一份了不起的资产负债表，该国直接位于中国沿海。考虑到发达的卫生系统，即使是一个巨大的黑影也不可怕。\n当然，对病毒的担忧也已经蔓延到岛国。餐馆不那么拥挤，更多的人戴着传声筒，活动也不那么频繁。但总的来说，日常生活照常进行。这与过去的糟糕经历和目前的良好准备有关。在73人死于非典之后，2003年政府设计了一个有效的系统来应对早期的流行病。从31号开始。2019年12月，在首次报告疑似疾病后，官员们已经在离开飞机前对来自中国武汉市的乘客进行了检查。比23号中国提前三天。1月武汉封锁，台湾已启动危机中心。一天后，6日禁止出口防护口罩。二月份，所有中国公民的入境都停止了，无论在哪是 啊。\n当局几乎可以在没有漏洞和隔离接触者的情况下读取感染链。这也适用于那些在高风险地区的人。2月底，有3万人被隔离或在他们身后。每天的拜访和电话确保14天内没有人离开公寓。台湾民主宪政国家也接受严惩。一个从中国回来的人，没有呆在家里，而是驾车穿越全国，在3月初被判处最高3万欧元的罚款。\n已经有15000人接受了测试，其能力足以每天进行3000多次测试。这与透明的沟通相结合，提高了政府的知名度。副总统是一位著名的流行病学家，作为卫生部长，他已经领导了抗击非典的斗争，这也很有帮助。\n台湾几乎没有世界卫生组织的支持，在中国的压力下，这个岛国甚至不能加入世贸组织。中华人民共和国认为台湾是其领土的一部分，因此被排除在所有联合国组织之外。台湾疾病管制人员不得出席专家会议及查阅资料库。尽管欧洲、美国和日本在幕后为台湾参与世贸组织网络争论不休，但中国依然强硬。\n几天前，当台湾国家科学院的研究人员报告说，他们新开发的SARS-CoV-2快速检测法可以在15分钟内得到证实时，中国官方媒体不久就认为这是他们国家的成功。可能需要几个月的时间来验证新方法的可靠性。然而，不可否认的是，台湾正在为抗击该病毒作出贡献。\n克劳斯·巴登哈根，台北\n在新加坡，H先生威胁是 啊。六个月监禁或几千欧元的罚款。这位38岁的老人最近死于Covid-19病。但在康复后，当局联系了他。他们指控他和他的妻子违反了传染病法。两人涉嫌犯罪：据称他们提供了关于他们在诊断前几天去过哪里的虚假信息。\n关于对这两名新加坡卫生部记者的指控，他还通过新闻稿向公众通报了被告的全名，并发出警告：那些在疾病防治人员调查期间撒谎的人犯罪严重。\n这个城邦以严格的行为规则和对监狱的监视而闻名，现在这种方法也指明了遏制新冠状病毒的方向。当局迄今为止取得了成功：波士顿哈佛陈冯富珍公共卫生学院（Harvard T.H.Chan School of Public Health）的研究人员在一项新的研究中假设，新加坡检测感染的能力是全球平均水平的三倍。\n新加坡战略的核心是所谓的接触追踪，即寻找Covid-19患者的接触者。卫生行政部门的工作人员应当在征求有关人员意见的基础上，对其过去两周的行踪作出完整记录。如果有人记不清他和谁在一起的确切地点，警方将被用于进一步调查。官员们随后对监控摄像头进行评估，例如，找出哪个出租车司机与一名感染者同行。\n当局能够追踪到所有的地方感染到六个集群并阻止传播。当然，任何与Covid-19病人有密切接触的人都必须在新加坡隔离是 啊。\n违反检疫条例也可能造成严重后果：一名45岁的外国人在新加坡拥有永久居留证，已被宣布为新加坡不受欢迎的人。在访问中国后，他没有遵守在公寓里住14天的要求。因此，这个人失去了他的家。”一些人认为这太苛刻了，”内政部长卡西瓦斯瓦纳森·尚穆加姆在脸书上写道。不过，在这个时候，每个人都必须合作。”\n民众对政府严厉政策的抵制还没有感受到。卫生专家对此赞不绝口：世卫组织负责人特德罗·阿达诺姆·盖布雷耶苏斯（Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus）建议远离这个城市国家：“我对新加坡在发现任何病例、跟踪接触和阻止传播方面所做的努力印象深刻。”\n马蒂亚斯·皮尔，曼谷，\n今年2月底，日本首相安倍晋三（Shinzo Abe）在接受日本媒体采访时，提出了一个要求：日本所有学校应关闭两周。人群众多的活动被取消或至少被转移以避免感染。在此之前，日本经济省已经建议国内企业让内政部对员工进行培训。而市民喜欢避开每天的高峰时段，以及购物中心等典型的收藏场所。\n这条来自官方的一贯路线是在日本统计900例感染病例时提出的。其中还包括“钻石公主”号游轮上约700人。正是因为这艘船，政府受到了强烈的批评。在2月初发现船上第一例感染病例后，检疫设施在两个多星期内一直相当模糊是 啊。在船上，没有明确的换防护服的命令，机组人员有时比乘客行动更自由，因而受到感染。当钻石公主最终被逐步疏散时，没有任何症状的乘客最初甚至乘坐公共交通工具被送回家。\n有一声尖叫。据介绍，日本政府在经历福岛核事故时，再次像2011年一样粗心大意。此后，安倍首相特别出席。今年2月底，北海道北岛实施区域紧急状态，实行事实上的宵禁，安倍已经开始让整个日本为这一步骤做好准备。\n上周二，他的政府终于启动了一项法律修正案，该修正案也将适用于Covid-19案件。在本周末，这可能会发生在两院。然后，安倍就不能再只建议关闭学校和取消活动，还可以给出指示。为了避免病毒不仅在国内传播，而且避免新的进口，日本目前不允许来自韩国、伊朗或意大利北部的人入境。\n现在很难说整件事有多有效。总感染的增长率目前似乎不是指数增长，而是呈线性增长。最近，日本，包括钻石公主号上的乘客，统计了1200个电晕病例，有1.26亿居民。此外，医生报告说，由于采取了各种预防措施，目前流感感染比平时少。然而，传染病学家也怀疑，日本的Covid-19疾病的实际数量甚至高于官方疾病，因为日本的老年人比例过高。\n费利克斯·里尔",

        "news_content_translate_en": "In China, the number of deaths has increased due to the new Coronavirus. The Health Commission reported 150-new Covid-19 deaths, more than ever in one day. Overall, therefore, 2.592 people died of lung disease in China. In addition, the number of infected by 409 cases increased to more than 77.000.\nMeanwhile, the Chinese authorities have already withdrawn the quarantine of the most severely affected millions of metropolis of Wuhan after a few hours. The easing had been announced \"without consent\" by a transport committee to local management and therefore \"invalid\", the city administration announced.\nPreviously it was said that people without a place of residence in the city would now be allowed to leave under certain conditions. It had counted that they showed no possible symptoms of infectious disease and had no contact with Coronavirus patients. It is also reported that people who show compelling reasons for leaving the city could have obtained a travel permit. These reasons include, for example, their reliance on the medical treatment of other diseases outside Wuhan. All persons wishing to leave need official authorization. They should also have registered with the local authorities at their Chinese destinations and had their health monitored for two weeks.\nWuhan is considered the starting point of the epidemic and was on 23rd. In January, the authorities largely sealed off the outside world. However, many foreign nationals have since been returned to their home countries on special flights. For the first time, experts from the World Health Organisation (WHO) have visited the citYeah. An international expert group visited two hospitals, the National Health Commission in China announced. One of the clinics had been provisionally set up in a sports centre.\nAccording to the Chinese authorities, the expert group also met the head of the Chinese Health Commission, Ma Xiaowei, and other persons responsible for the disease protection of the province of Hubei, in which Wuhan is located. The WHO representatives were reported to have arrived in China more than a week ago.\nAt the end of 2019, China reported to the World Health Organisation, WHO, the incidence of pneumonia of unclear cause from Wuhan. A week later, researchers identified a novel virus as the cause: they called it 2019-nCov. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. It is now known as Sars-CoV-2 (CoV stands for Coronavirus, Sars for respiratory disease caused by a similar pathogen).\nSars-CoV-2 may have spread from a food market in Wuhan. It also sold exotic animals such as reptiles. The lung disease that the new virus can cause is now called Covid-19 (English for Coronavirus disease; Coronavirus disease). The disease is called zoonosis, a disease caused by an animal pathogen. Parts of the viral effluent of Sars-CoV-2 are the same pathogens that infect bats. The new virus may have been transmitted to humans via an unknown intermediary.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of 2019 about 2.500, every third party has died of itYeah.\nOverall, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause colds.\nMedical practitioners assume that the virus is transmitted from person to person mainly by drip infection.\nThe WHO recommends general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nMore than 200.000 cases of Corona worldwide (stand 18. In addition, there is a high dark number, which researchers suspect roughly somewhere between 50 and 80 percent of all cases. Several thousand people have died as a result of this worldwide. In most cases, however, the infection is very mild. Among the victims of death are, in particular, people with serious illnesses and elderly people.\nFollow the progress of registered cases in Germany on this map.\nThe number of infected worldwide tested positive for Corona shows this map from Johns Hopkins University.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The WHO shared on 28th. In January, approximately one fifth of those reported as infected become seriously ill by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. Meanwhile, the WHO is treating the disease as a pandemic. Various states have imposed entry and exit restrictions to slow down the spread.\nTypical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Countries around the world have reported cases of infection, including Germany. Researchers are currently working on therapies and vaccinations. Initial clinical studies with vaccines have begun, i. e. few patients are given a test vaccination.\nChina's head of state and party Xi Jinping spoke the day before of the \"biggest health crisis\" since the founding of the state 194Yeah. He called for vigorous measures to control the epidemic. After economic life had been severely slowed down or even halted in some places, according to state media reports, the President also called for the slow resumption of work and production, depending on the assessment of health risks on the ground.\nIn regions where the risk is \"relatively low\", the fight against the virus should focus on preventing its introduction, while production and public life should be restarted. Areas with a \"medium risk\" should resume work and production depending on the local situation of the epidemic, while regions \"with a risk\" should continue to focus fully on control and prevention.\nSouth Korea also reported a further spread of the virus. With 161 further confirmed cases, the number of infected people is now in 763 humans. The number of deaths also increased to seven. After China and Japan, South Korea is now the country with the third highest infection rates. The majority of newly reported infections focus on the southeastern millionaire city of Daegu and its surroundings. Previously, the government had issued the highest alert for infectious diseases. Only 129 of the new infections were again counted among members of the Christian sect Shincheonji Church of Jesus. More than half of all cases in the country are those of the sect, which is strongly represented in Daegu.\nIn Europe, Italy is most affected by more than 150 infections and three deaths. On Sunday evening, trains between Italy and Austria were stopped for several hours. Two Eurocities were stopped by the Austrian authorities at the Brenner on their way from Venice to Munich. One of the trains had two German women on board who had fever and severe cougYeah. However, according to the Austrian Ministry of the Interior, they were tested negative in Verona. After that, the 500-passengers were able to continue to Munich.\nIn the north of Italy, several municipalities were sealed off. In the province of Lodi in Lombardy, ten municipalities were declared closed zones, as well as the municipality of Vo in Veneto. Schools, universities and museums remain closed. The carnival in Venice, which was due to end by Tuesday, was also prematurely ended.\nDiseases and deaths have been recorded in more than twenty other countries. Recently, initial infections from Kuwait, Bahrain and Afghanistan have been reported. In Iran, the number of deaths was reported to have increased to twelve.\nBecause of the new Coronavirus, protective masks have been sold out in many pharmacies for weeks, and they are scarcely supplied.\" There are indeed significant and immediate supply bottlenecks,\"said Thomas Porstner, Managing Director of the Federal Association of Wholesale Pharmaceuticals. The increased demand was due to the Coronavirus, according to a spokesman of the German Pharmaceutical Association (ABDA).\nHowever, concrete figures are not available for both associations. At the moment, however, there are only \"smallest quantities,\" Porstner said. Many wholesalers could no longer order goods. When manufacturers can produce enough masks, be unclear.\nBut this was not a cause for panic, the ABDA spokesman said. Healthy people travelling in Germany do not need a mask.\"A simple mouth-nose protection, as nurses and doctors wear it in surgeries, does not protect against infection with the new virus Sars-CoV-2.\" It is more a matter of respect for others. They shall be protected from their own germs by the mask.",

At the end of February, when the Colorado virus infected 500 people a day in the country, Washington agreed to lift the humanitarian aid ban.\nIn a talk with Russia News Agency, Iran expert Yuli sweshnikov stressed that the national attention is now focused on the fight against Colorado virus. No one has noticed the US sanctions on five scientists.\n\"In the face of the epidemic, Tehran believes that Washington's sanctions policy is genocide and obscurantism. The situation is complex. China, Kuwait and Qatar help Iranians. Who has also provided support.

The currency soared. Internal tensions are increasing and may arise in the future. But now, in the first place - hoping to save people's diseases, \"experts point out.\n\"The new sanctions are a response to the attack on Iraq's Taji base. Two American soldiers were killed. Considering that the murder of American troops in Iraq at the end of December led to a series of reactions leading to the elimination of the leader of kesser Kassem Sulaimani, The tough response is predictableAbout The White House has no doubt that Iran is behind all these attacks, \"said Andre barklitsky, a consultant at the peel center.\nIn a talk with the Russian news agency, adlan magoway, an analyst at the International Research Institute of the international maritime organization, said that even if the us relaxed sanctions, Not all countries will immediately start to help Iran. \" Restrictive measures do not affect the trading of medical supplies today. But when a foreign bank deals, even with drugs, the U.S. Treasury's watchdog can still use it as a high-risk category. As a result, it's easier for loan organizations not to have contact with Tehran than to report to the Americans later. \"\nHe believes that the Americans will not lift the sanctions, and will continue to observe the spread of social tensions and the deterioration of the political system in the country. \" When the Colorado virus outbreak drops, there may be more protests.

As Peskov pointed out, when deciding to provide assistance to the Italian Republic, Putin was first and foremost motivated by humanitarian considerations. \" The representative of the Kremlin said that no country can fight the pandemic alone and must work together to help each other. \" All countries are on the same boat and must meet this challenge together.\nNikolai Patrushev, Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, told reporters on Wednesday that Russia intends to continue to help stop propaganda for the countries most in need. In order to prevent further penetration of the infection into the territory of the Russian Federation. He believes that countries need to respond to the existing risks of new biological threats in a timely manner and strengthen national health and epidemic prevention systems. About\nLeaders of the seven Party group\nIt is expected that US President Donald Trapp will participate in the G20 meeting in his capacity as chairman of the group of seven this year. U.S. Treasury Secretary Stephen mnuchin stressed in a conference call earlier this week between G20 finance ministers and central bank governors, We all recognize the need to work together to support the economy and coordinate global action.\nIn addition to G20 leaders, the heads of state invited to the videoconference, especially Spain and Singapore, as well as representatives of international organizations, especially international organizations, will attend the videoconference. world health organization.\nAsian experience - Focus\nChinese President Xi Jinping will be one of the important participants in the summit. A few days ago, he visited the city of Wuhan in Central China, where it is believed that there was an initial explosion in colonavirus. By doing so, China's head of state marked a symbolic end to two months of intense fighting against the epidemic. At the same time, the country remains highly alert to a possible second wave of covid-19.\nChina also expressed its willingness to help other countries fight AIDAbout Such assistance may be provided to countries in Italy, Brazil, Belarus, Africa and Latin America, which carry goods with medical masks and other means of protection, Preservative. Chinese medical teams have flown to some countries.\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has decided to postpone the Olympic Games to 2021, and he will attend the G20 leaders' meeting. At present, the coronal water situation in Japan is under monitoring: local authorities plan to resume school education from April 1. However, we continue to appeal to the public not to participate in mass activities. At the same time, Japanese experts do not rule out a second wave of the epidemic - the number of people infected in Tokyo has increased significantly in recent days.\nPresident of the Republic of Korea Ming zhe pointed out before the G20 summit, This means that coronavirus is no longer just a public health problem, but a crisis in the public, financial and economic fields. 11. Mun Zhe in pointed out that measures must be taken to minimize damage to the world economy and ensure commercial activities. South Korea is now often used as a model for a country, As a result of serious and rapid action by local authorities, the spread of the Colorado virus was quickly stoppedAbout\nEurope has become a new centre\nEuropean leaders are expected to be actively involved, the second Colorado virus transmission center after China. According to the Champs Elysees sources, the conference call will discuss issues such as vaccine development and new treatments. And assess the potential impact of the current crisis on major economies.\nSteffen zaibert, an official spokesman for kabmin, told reporters, Germany looks forward to a coordinated response to the \"spread of Colorado virus\" at the G20 virtual summit. He did not provide specific details. According to Seibert, Given the clear global impact of the crisis, Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomes the organization of negotiations in the form of greater international coordination efforts. Page: 1\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson's office has yet to confirm his participation in Thursday's G20 summit. However, in a telephone conversation earlier with the leaders of the other 20 countries, Johnson stressed the importance of international cooperation to combat the spread of the new Colorado virus. Especially at the G20 levelAbout The UK said it needed to exchange experience and scientific data and take measures to support the global economy, (a) Assist developing countries in disease control and provide additional funding for the development of new coronavirus vaccine programmes.\nItaly did not formally comment on the upcoming summit. Local authorities, led by Prime Minister Giuseppe conte, have spared no effort to combat the spread of the country's coronavirus, which has infected more than 750000 people. China has more than twice the world's population.\nOnline world\nThe coronaveros pandemic has forced governments and major public organizations around the world to turn most of their key meetings into teleconferences. The G-7 foreign ministers held talks in this form for the first time on March 25, and US President Donald Trapp has promised, Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the G7 leaders' summit in June will also be held in virtual form.\nThis week, a conference call was held between finance ministers and central bank governors of the G20. At the end of the meeting, Christine Georgiev, President of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), stressed that in 2020, in the context of the Colorado virus pandemic, the world economy is expected to decline, May be worse than the recession of the world financial crisis in 200About According to Georgieva, in order to achieve economic recovery next year, priority must be given to containing and strengthening health systems in all countries. She believes that developing countries will face the greatest difficulty, because developed economies usually respond better to crises. \"\nA new outbreak of coronavirus has occurred in Central China. Later, it spread to more than 150 countries and was recognized by the World Health Organization. According to the latest data, more than 440000 people around the world are living with HIV.

        "news_content_translate_en": "China's President Xi Jinping began a monitoring visit to Wuhan on Tuesday morning. Just six months ago, the name of the city was rarely said to an unsuspecting reader. However, after the outbreak of previously unknown diseases in 1-1 million megacities, the new diseases caused by coronavirus are: The axe is firmly rooted in the memory of most people in the world.\nAs of that date, 115 countries had been affected: more than 100000 people had been infected. (unit: 1000 people) One of them is dead. In this context, Xi Jinping's visit to the \"Colorado Russia\" radio center is symbolic. It is said that China has reversed the situation, at least controlling it. But is it true?\nDuring his visit, Xi reportedly visited a landmark place for the prevention and control of coronavirus, the \"hoshen mountain infectious disease hospital\", which was built within a week at the peak of the epidemic. According to state media, China's president spoke with medical staff, soldiers and patients. Although, according to the photos distributed later, the distance between the head of state and the staff is 3-4 meters, and the patients are completely connected by videoAbout Xi Jinping thanked doctors, military personnel, state functionaries and Party staff for their hard work, and expressed confidence, The decisive and final victory over the epidemic will soon be won in the country.\nChinese leaders may want to show the people of China and the world that the Chinese government has confidence. In a way, it could be, After Xi Jinping's visit to Wuhan, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets began to close down, and the trend of the stock market changed greatly, with remarkable results Rise in price But what is the long-term effect?\nReasons for optimism\nAccording to a report released Tuesday by the National Health Commission, only 19 new cases of coronavirus infection occurred in China on March 9. 17 of them went directly to Wuhan, and the other two were imported from Wuhan. That is to say, people from foreign countries were found in Wuhan. In any case, this is the lowest number since the authorities began issuing their daily reports on 20 January. In addition, for the third day in a row, new cases of infection in China only occurred in Wuhan, while in other regions, there were zero cases.\nOn Tuesday, all 14 temporary hospitals were closed to treat people with coronavirus infectionAbout The last group of 49 patients were discharged from Hongshan stadium hospital, Wuchang District. However, it is unlikely that China, especially Wuhan and Hubei provinces, will soon return to normal life, as strict measures to contain the epidemic will last for a long time.\nPeople's daily pointed out in an interview with members of the ad hoc expert group of the central government on HIV / AIDS on March 5, Zhang Boli, academician of the Chinese Academy of engineering and President of Tianjin University of traditional Chinese medicine, said: \"at the end of April, except for Hubei Province, other parts of the country are likely to become models of traditional Chinese medicine.\" It'il puts the mask and restores the normal way of life. \"Hubei Province, especially Wuhan, is one month later than the whole country,\" he said. However, many experts expressed doubts about this optimistic forecast, and the experts themselves expressed reservations that the measures should be postponed.\nExternal threats\nMore than 100 countries were affected, including China's close neighbors, Japan and the Republic of Korea. In this context, \"disease\" is more and more likely to enter the country, that is to say, infected people are more and more likely to enter from abroadAbout China's Ministry of foreign affairs has announced the establishment of a professional center within its organization to assess foreign epidemics and risks. When reporting Xi Jinping's visit to Wuhan state media It has been stressed many times that the final victory over Colorado is coming. However, mainland Chinese epidemiologists (without Hong Kong) are more cautious. Zhong Nanshan, chairman of the special committee for epidemic prevention of the National Health Commission, said on Monday, It is estimated that the epidemic will continue worldwide at least until June this year. With the increasing number of infections worldwide, their forecasts are more pessimistic, with the epidemic continuing at least until the end of the year.\nBlack February\nAlthough it is too early to estimate the actual loss and the Chinese authorities have assured that the outbreak has no significant impact on China's economy, the figures are the opposite. A two-month report released by Chinese customs in January and February showed that China's exports shrank by 17.2% due to the outbreak (an increase of 7.9% compared with December 2019About However, imports fell by 4% due to an increase in the supply of food and medical supplies from abroad, compared with a 16.5% increase in December 2019. The business activity index for services and industry (PMI) has updated its lowest level since the world economic crisis.\nAccording to the Euler Hermes insurance company, the outbreak in China will cause considerable losses. Exports lost $108 billion, tourism lost $72 billion, and transportation lost $100 billion. In this way, China's total losses will reach about 190 billion US dollars.\nTouch Wallet\nMoreover, the epidemic affects not only the economy, but also the wallets of ordinary people, regardless of their social class. Many enterprises and companies are completely or partially idle, which will reduce or completely deprive employees of their wages. This will particularly affect domestic migrants, who come to big cities to make money, compared with about 300 million in China.\nGavekal Dragonomics estimates that the total wage loss of these immigrants is about 800 billion yuan). This damage can be described as \"irreparable\" because of the income of migrants, who are mainly engaged in production and services, Directly depends on bonus and working hourAbout Their reduced income in turn affects consumption. In general, there are many problems: temporary closure or incomplete enterprises, supply disruption, The destruction of the world's production chain - this list can last for a long time. The Chinese government has expressed its intention to support enterprises. The proposed measures include tax exemptions, preferences and subsidies. Above all, however, the authorities must now find a delicate balance between taking strict measures to deal with the new outbreak of the epidemic and restoring the normal functioning of the country's economy. Any one-sided approach would undermine that precious balance and could have serious consequences.\nCredit is more expensive than money\nEpidemiologists from Hong Kong, foreign countries and even China have repeatedly pointed out that authorities in Wuhan and Hubei Province have tried to cover up the development of the epidemic, This has led to such serious consequences.\nAmong Chinese sources, December 1 is the earliest known date of infection. For a month, the epidemic has been spreading, but the authorities remain silent. On December 30, Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital, told social network colleagues that, as far as he knew at that time, there were several atypical cases in the city. pneumoniAbout A few days later, he was subpoenaed by the police for spreading false information on the Internet and was criminally punished for a second offence. A few days later, he would infect himself with covid-19 from a patient and die within a month.\nThe incident aroused strong repercussions from Chinese and foreign audiences. Li Wenliang has become a hero and critic of bureaucrats in public opinion. They worry about their career and hide the truth. Later, leading cadres in Wuhan and Hubei Province were reorganized, and the central government agreed with the Chinese society. And all the power of the national information machine is to turn this epidemic into a national achievement, The heinous crimes committed by the Chinese people under the important leadership of the central government.\nHowever, China's reputation loss due to AIDS in the international arena remains to be assessed. It also applies to Colorado's attacks on the image of domestic political leaders.\nHowever, there is a challenge in assessing the negative impact of AIDS on China. Just a few weeks ago, economists speculated that Russia would only attack China and wait for its economy to rejoin the international production chainAbout Now, in the context of the epidemic spreading to the rest of the world, experts are trying to predict the damage that has already been done to the global economy.\nChina is gradually recovering, but now it has to wait for other countries, including the world's major economies and their major partners, The epidemic will be brought under control and economic life will return to normal.

        "news_content_translate_en": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Several months before the coronavirus pandemic began, the Trump administration eliminated a key American public health position in Beijing intended to help detect disease outbreaks in China, Reuters has learned.\nThe American disease expert, a medical epidemiologist embedded in China’s disease control agency, left her post in July, according to four sources with knowledge of the issue. The first cases of the new coronavirus may have emerged as early as November, and as cases exploded, the Trump administration in February chastised China for censoring information about the outbreak and keeping U.S. experts from entering the country to help.\n“It was heartbreaking to watch,” said Bao-Ping Zhu, a Chinese American who served in that role, which was funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 2007 and 2011. “If someone had been there, public health officials and governments across the world could have moved much faster.”\nZhu and the other sources said the American expert, Dr. Linda Quick, was a trainer of Chinese field epidemiologists who were deployed to the epicenter of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases.\nAs an American CDC employee, they said, Quick was in an ideal position to be the eyes and ears on the ground for the United States and other countries on the coronavirus outbreak, and might have alerted them to the growing threat weeks earlier.\nNo other foreign disease experts were embedded to lead the program after Quick left in July, according to the sources. Zhu said an embedded expert can often get word of outbreaks early, after forming close relationships with Chinese counterparts.\nZhu and the other sources said Quick could have provided real-time information to U.S. and other officials around the world during the first weeks of the outbreak, when they said the Chinese government tamped down on the release of information and provided erroneous assessments.\nQuick left amid a bitter U.S. trade dispute with China when she learned her federally funded post, officially known as resident adviser to the U.S. Field Epidemiology Training Program in China, would be discontinued as of September, the sources said. The U.S. CDC said it first learned of a “cluster of 27 cases of pneumonia” of unexplained origin in Wuhan, China, on Dec. 31.\nSince then, the outbreak of the disease known as COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide, killing more than 13,600 people, infecting more than 317,000. The epidemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems in some countries, including Italy, and threatens to do so in the United States and elsewhere.\nDuring a press briefing on Sunday shortly after this story was first published, President Donald Trump dismissed the Reuters report as similar to other stories regarding the CDC that he described as “100 percent wrong,” without addressing whether the role had been eliminated.\nU.S. CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield maintained the agency’s presence in China “is actually being augmented as we speak,” without elaborating.\nIn a statement to Reuters before the report was published, the CDC said the elimination of the adviser position did not hinder Washington’s ability to get information and “had absolutely nothing to do with CDC not learning of cases in China earlier.”\nThe agency said its decision not to have a resident adviser “started well before last summer and was due to China’s excellent technical capability and maturity of the program.”\nThe CDC said it has assigned two of its Chinese employees as “mentors” to help with the training program. The agency did not respond to questions about the mentors’ specific role or expertise.\nThe CDC would not make Quick, who still works for the agency, available for comment.\nAsked for comment on Chinese transparency and responsiveness to the outbreak, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred Reuters to remarks by spokesman Geng Shuang on Friday. Geng said the country “has adopted the strictest, most comprehensive, and most thorough prevention and control measures in an open, transparent, and responsible manner, and informed the (World Health Organization) and relevant countries and regions of the latest situation in a timely manner.”\nOne disease expert told Reuters he was skeptical that the U.S. resident adviser would have been able to get earlier or better information to the Trump administration, given the Chinese government’s suppression of information.\n“In the end, based on circumstances in China, it probably wouldn’t have made a big difference,” Scott McNabb, who was a CDC epidemiologist for 20 years and is now a research professor at Emory University. “The problem was how the Chinese handled it. What should have changed was the Chinese should have acknowledged it earlier and didn’t.”\nAlex Azar, secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) said on Friday that his agency learned of the coronavirus in early January, based on Redfield’s conversations with “Chinese colleagues.”\nRedfield learned that “this looks to be a novel coronavirus” from Dr. Gao Fu, the head of the China CDC, according to an HHS administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “Dr. Redfield always talked to Dr. Gao,” the official said.\nHHS and CDC did not make Azar or Redfield available for comment.\nZhu and other sources said U.S. leaders should not have been relying on the China CDC director for alerts and updates. In general, they said, officials in China downplayed the severity of the outbreak in the early weeks and did not acknowledge evidence of person-to-person transmission until Jan. 20.\nAfter the epidemic exploded and China had imposed strict quarantines, Trump administration officials complained that the Chinese had censored information about the outbreak and that the United States had been unable to get American disease experts into the country to help contain the spread.\nAzar told CNN on Feb. 14 that he and CDC director Redfield officially offered to send a CDC team into China on Jan. 6 but still had not received permission for them to enter the country. HHS oversees the CDC.\n“Dr. Redfield and I made the offer on January 6th - 36 days ago, 60,000 cases and 1,300 deaths ago,” Azar said. “We made the offer to send the CDC experts in to assist their Chinese colleagues to get to the bottom of key scientific questions like, how transmissible is this disease? What is the severity? What is the incubation period and can there be asymptomatic transmission?”\nDays later, the World Health Organization secured permission to send a team that included two U.S. experts. The team visited between Feb. 16th and 24th. By then, China had reported more than 75,000 cases.\nOn Feb. 25, the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak at home, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused China of mishandling the epidemic through its “censorship” of medical professionals and media.\nRelations between the two countries have deteriorated since then, as Trump has labeled the coronavirus the “Chinese virus” - a description the Chinese have condemned as stigmatizing. Last week, the Chinese government announced that Americans from three U.S. news organizations, The New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, would be expelled from China.\nThe decision to eliminate Quick’s job came as the CDC has scaled back the number of U.S. staffers in China over the last two years, the sources told Reuters.\n“We had already withdrawn many technical public health experts,” the same expert said.\nThe CDC, however, disputed that staffing was a problem or that its information had been limited by the move. “It was not the staffing shortage that limited our ability” it said.\nThe U.S. CDC team in Beijing now includes three American citizens in permanent roles, an additional American who is temporary and around 10 Chinese nationals, the agency said. Of the Americans, one is an influenza expert with expertise in respiratory disease. COVID-19 is not influenza, though it can cause severe respiratory illness.\nThe CDC team, aside from Quick, was housed at U.S. Embassy facilities. No American CDC staffer besides Quick was embedded with China’s disease control agency, the sources said.\nChina in recent weeks has reported a dramatic slowdown in new cases, the result of drastic containment measures including the lockdown of Hubei province, home to 60 million people.\nNevertheless, the infectious disease experts who spoke with Reuters said, the United States could use people like Quick with contacts on the ground, especially if fears of a second wave of infections materializes.\nThomas R. Frieden, a former director of the CDC, said that if the U.S. resident adviser had still been in China, “it is possible that we would know more today about how this coronavirus is spreading and what works best to stop it.”\nDr. George Conway, a medical epidemiologist who knows Quick and had served as resident advisor between 2012 and 2015, said funding for the position had been tenuous for years because of a perennial debate among U.S health officials over whether China should be paying for funding its own training program.\nYet since the training program was launched in 2001, the sources familiar with it say, it has not only strengthened the ranks of Chinese epidemiologists in the field, but also fostered collegial relationships between public health officials in the two countries.\n“We go there as credentialed diplomats and return home as close colleagues and often as friends,” Conway said.\nIn 2007, Dr. Robert Fontaine, a CDC epidemiologist  and one of the longest serving U.S. officials in the adviser’s position, received China’s highest honor for outstanding contributions to public health due to his contribution as a foreigner in helping to detect and investigate clusters of pneumonia of unknown cause.\nBut since last year, Frieden and others said, growing tensions between the Trump administration and China’s leadership have apparently damaged the collaboration.\n“The message from the administration was, ‘Don’t work with China, they’re our rival,’” Frieden said.\nTrump’s re-election campaign sent out a statement Sunday evening dismissing controversy about the CDC’S cut as a matter of politics.\n“Democrats are eager to politicize the coronavirus crisis and weaponize it against President Trump, the statement said. “In so doing, they’re siding with the Chinese and providing cover for Beijing’s cover-up.”\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "华盛顿（路透社）-路透社获悉，在冠状病毒大流行开始前几个月，特朗普政府取消了美国在北京的一个重要公共卫生职位，该职位旨在帮助发现中国爆发的疾病。\n据四位知情人士透露，这位美国疾病专家是中国疾病控制机构的一名医学流行病学家，今年7月离职。新冠状病毒的首批病例可能早在11月就已经出现，随着病例的爆发，特朗普政府在2月就斥责中国审查有关疫情的信息，阻止美国专家进入中国提供帮助。\n2007年至2011年间，美国疾病预防控制中心（U.S.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention）资助了担任这一职务的华裔朱宝平（Bao Ping Zhu），他说：“看到这一幕令人心碎。“如果有人在场，全世界的公共卫生官员和政府可能会行动得更快。”\n朱和其他消息来源说，美国专家琳达·奎克博士是中国现场流行病学家的培训师，他们被派往疫情中心，帮助追踪、调查和控制疾病。\n他们说，作为美国疾控中心的一名员工，Quick处于一个理想的位置，可以成为美国和其他国家在冠状病毒爆发时的耳目，并可能在几周前提醒他们注意日益增长的威胁。\n据消息人士透露，在Quick于7月离开后，没有其他外国疾病专家参与领导该项目。朱镕基说，在与中国同行建立密切关系之后，一位嵌入式专家往往可以很早得到疫情爆发的消息。\n朱和其他消息来源说，Quick可以向美国提供实时信. 以及世界各地的其他官员在疫情爆发的头几周表示，中国政府严厉打击信息发布，并提供了错误的评估。\n消息人士说，在美国与中国激烈的贸易争端中，她得知自己在中国的联邦资助职位（官方称为美国现场流行病学培训项目驻中国顾问）将于9月停止工作，于是迅速离开。美国疾控中心说，他们于12月31日在中国武汉首次发现了一个来源不明的“27例肺炎病例群”。\n此后，这种被称为COVID-19的疾病在全球迅速蔓延，造成13600多人死亡，317000多人感染。这一流行病已使包括意大利在内的一些国家的医疗系统不堪重负，并威胁到美国和其他地方的医疗系统。\n在这篇报道首次发表后不久的周日新闻发布会上，美国总统特朗普（Donald Trump）驳斥路透社的报道与他所说的“100%错误”的有关疾病预防控制中心的其他报道相似，但没有说明这一角色是否已被取消。\nU、 美国疾控中心主任罗伯特雷德菲尔德博士坚持说，该机构在中国的存在“实际上是在扩大，正如我们所说，”没有详细说明。\n中国疾控中心在报告发表前向路透社发表声明说，取消顾问职位并不妨碍华盛顿获取信息的能力，“与疾控中心没有更早了解中国的病例完全无关”\n该机构表示，其决定不设常驻顾问“早在去年夏天就开始了，这是因为中国的技术能力和项目的成熟。”\n中国疾控中心表示，已指派两名中国员工作为“导师”协助培训计划。该机构没有回答有关导师具体角色或专业知识的问题。\n疾控中心不愿让仍在该机构工作的Quick发表评.\n在被问及中国对疫情的透明度和反应能力时，中国外交部援引路透社发言人耿爽周五的讲话。耿雁生说，中国“以公开、透明、负责任的方式，采取了最严格、最全面、最彻底的防控措施，及时向（世界卫生组织）和有关国家和地区通报了最新情况。”\n一位疾病专家对路透社表示，鉴于中国政府对信息的压制，他怀疑这位美国常驻顾问是否能够更早或更好地向特朗普政府获取信息。\n“最终，根据中国的情况，这可能不会有太大的改变，”斯科特·麦克纳布说，他是疾控中心的流行病学家，20年了，现在是埃默里大学的研究教授。“问题是中国人是如何处理的。应该改变的是，中国人应该早一点承认，而不是。”\n美国卫生与公众服务部（HHS）部长阿历克斯•阿扎尔（Alex Azar）上周五表示，根据雷德菲尔德与“中国同事”的谈话，他的机构在1月初得知了冠状病毒\n据一位不愿透露姓名的卫生部官员透露，雷德菲尔德从中国疾控中心主任高福博士那里得知，“这看起来是一种新型冠状病毒”。“雷德菲尔德医生总是和高医生说话，”这位官员说。\n卫生部和疾病预防控制中心没有让Azar或Redfield发表评论。\n朱镕基和其他消息人士说，美国领导人不应该依赖中国疾控中心主任发出警报和更新。他们说，总的来说，中国官员在最初几周低估了疫情的严重性，直到1月20日才承认有人与人之间传播的证.\n疫情爆发后，中国实施了严格的隔离措施，特朗普政府官员抱怨说，中国审查了有关疫情的信息，美国无法让美国疾病专家入境帮助遏制疫情蔓延。\n阿扎尔2月14日告诉CNN，他和疾控中心主任雷德菲尔德1月6日正式提出派遣一支疾控中心小组进入中国，但仍然没有得到允许他们进入中国。卫生部监督疾病预防控制中心。\n阿扎尔说：“雷德菲尔德医生和我在1月6日至36天前提出了这个提议，6万例病例和1300例死亡。“我们提出让疾控中心的专家来帮助他们的中国同事弄清关键的科学问题，比如，这种疾病是如何传播的？严重程度如何？潜伏期是多少，会不会有无症状的传播？”\n几天后，世界卫生组织获得了派遣一个由两名美国专家组成的小组的许可。该队在2月16日至24日期间访问过。到那时，中国已经报告了75000多起病例。\n2月25日，疾病预防控制中心告诉美国公众准备在国内爆发疫情的第一天，美国国务卿蓬佩奥指责中国通过对医疗专业人员和媒体的“审查”不当处理疫情。\n此后，两国关系恶化，特朗普将冠状病毒贴上“中国病毒”的标签，中国人谴责这种说法是污名化的。上周，中国政府宣布，来自纽约时报、华盛顿邮报和华尔街日报三家美国新闻机构的美国人将被驱逐出中国。\n消息人士对路透表示，在决定取消Quick的工作之际，中国疾控中心在过去两年缩减了在华美国员工的数量。\n“我们已经撤回了许多公共卫生技术专家，”同一位专家.\n不过，疾控中心反驳说，人员配备是一个问题，或其信息受到了这一行动的限制。“不是人员短缺限制了我们的能力，”它说。\n该机构说，美国疾控中心在北京的团队目前包括三名美国公民担任永久职务，另外一名美国人是临时的，约有10名中国公民。在美国人中，有一位是流感专家，对呼吸道疾病有专长。COVID-19不是流感，尽管它可以引起严重的呼吸道疾病。\n疾控中心的小组，除了Quick，被安置在美国大使馆的设施。消息人士说，除了Quick之外，没有一名美国疾控中心的工作人员与中国的疾病控制机构有联系。\n近几周来，中国报告称，由于采取了严厉的遏制措施，包括对拥有6000万人口的湖北省实施封锁，新案件数量急剧下降。\n尽管如此，接受路透社采访的传染病专家说，美国可以利用像Quick这样的人在当地进行接触，特别是在第二波传染病的恐惧出现时。\n美国疾病预防控制中心（CDC）前主任托马斯弗里登（Thomas R.Frieden）说，如果美国常驻顾问仍在中国，“我们今天可能会更多地了解这种冠状病毒是如何传播的，以及什么最有效地阻止它。”\n医学流行病学家乔治康威博士（George Conway）知道得很快，曾在2012年至2015年期间担任驻地顾问。他说，由于美国卫生官员就中国是否应该为自己的培训项目出资展开长期争论，多年来，这一职位的资金一直很薄弱。\n然而，据知情人士透露，自2001年启动这项培训计划以来，它不仅加强了中国流行病学家在这一领域的队伍，而且还促进了两国公共卫生官员之间的合作关系。\n康威说：“我们作为有资格的外交官去那里，然后作为亲密的同事和朋友回家。.\n2007年，疾控中心流行病学家、担任顾问职务时间最长的美国官员之一罗伯特·方丹博士因其作为外国人在帮助发现和调查不明原因的肺炎集群方面的贡献，获得了中国对公共卫生做出杰出贡献的最高荣誉。\n但弗里登等人表示，自去年以来，特朗普政府与中国领导人之间日益紧张的关系显然损害了双方的合作。\n弗里登说：“政府发出的信息是，‘不要与中国合作，他们是我们的竞争对手’。\n特朗普的连任竞选团队周日晚间发表声明，驳斥了有关疾控中心削减开支的争议，认为这是一个政治问题。\n声明说：“民主党急于将冠状病毒危机政治化，并将其武器化以对抗特朗普总统。“他们这样做是站在中国一边，为北京的掩盖提供掩护。",

        "news_content_translate_en": "LONDON (Reuters) - Extending school and work closures at the coronavirus’ ground zero in China may delay a second wave of infections, researchers said on Thursday, urging the rest of the world to take note.\nWith containment measures largely successful and the epidemic’s epicenter now in Europe, China has loosened a two-month lockdown in the city of Wuhan where the new coronavirus is thought to have jumped from wildlife to people late last year.\nBut a study in The Lancet Public Health journal suggested continuing Wuhan’s shutdowns until April would push a potential second wave of COVID-19 - the disease caused by the new virus - until later in the year. That would give health services more time to recover and expand, potentially saving lives.\n“The city now needs to be really careful to avoid prematurely lifting physical distancing measures, because that could lead to an earlier secondary peak in cases,” said Kiesha Prem, a specialist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), who co-led the research.\n“If they relax the restrictions gradually, this is likely to both delay and flatten the peak.”\nThe study used mathematical modeling to simulate either extending or relaxing school and workplace closures in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people whose name has become synonymous with the coronavirus for much of the world.\nBy lifting control measures now, a second rush of infections may occur in late August, the analysis suggested. But keeping lockdown measures until April would likely delay a second peak until October — giving healthcare workers a chance to regroup.\nThose findings were “crucial for policy makers everywhere”, said Tim Colbourn, an expert in global health epidemiology at University College London, who was not directly involved in the study.\nStunned by the disease’s rapid spread, governments around the world are trying to replicate China’s draconian lockdown measures while also working out the risk of recurrences once the epidemic peaks have passed in their countries.\n“Our results won’t look exactly the same in another country,” said Yang Liu, an LSHTM expert who also worked on the research. “But we think one thing probably applies everywhere: physical distancing measures are very useful, and we need to carefully adjust their lifting to avoid subsequent waves of infection ... If those waves come too quickly, that could overwhelm health systems.”\nWorld Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Wednesday expressed the same view, saying lockdowns were the best way to curb transmission.\n“The last thing any country needs is to open schools and businesses only to be forced to close them again because of a resurgence,” he said.\n",

They are high-tech versions of the “iron lungs” that kept people alive into the 1950s during fierce polio epidemics.\nWorldwide, the devices have become shorthand for the rapid advance of the disease — and the desperation of officials who fear their stocks are inadequate. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the 3,000 devices in his state where 20 people have died are a fraction of what he’d like to have.\n“The entire world is trying to buy ventilators,” Cuomo said, according to a transcript published on Wednesday, adding he is hoping to tap a U.S. federal government stockpile.\nGermany’s Draegerwerk (DRWG_p.DE) last week got a government order for 10,000, equal to a typical year’s production.\nWieland’s company in the Swiss Alps has boosted normal production of some 15,000 ventilators annually by 30-40% and now can produce about 80 ventilators daily.\nHe has shifted his 1,400 employees to seven-day work weeks as well as borrowed workers from other companies in the Rhine River valley where his two-year-old ventilator plant is located.\nLast week, Hamilton Medical shipped 400 ventilators to Italy, whose intensive care units have been overwhelmed by more than 35,000 cases of the rapidly spreading virus and almost 3,000 deaths.\nAbout 50% of those with coronavirus in Italy accepted into intensive care units are dying, compared with typical mortality rates of 12% to 16% in such units.\nWieland said a similar outbreak in Britain, now with more than 2,600 cases and about 100 deaths, would swamp the system there, too.\n“They are not well equipped with ventilators and intensive care stations,” he said. “They invested very little, and I think now they will pay the price.”\nUK health minister Matt Hancock has acknowledged the existing stock of 5,000 ventilators is inadequate.\n“We think we need many times more than that and we are saying if you produce a ventilator then we will buy it,” he said earlier this week. “No number is too high.”\nWieland said he was in “close contact” with UK medical leaders and aimed to prioritize shipments there soon, though for now Italy was taking precedence.\nBut he also has orders from the United States, Turkey, France and China, where in January he stocked up on components in anticipation of rising demand as the virus spread from its origins in Wuhan.\nThe UK’s Intensive Care Society, an organization of medical professionals, did not immediately return emails and phone calls from Reuters seeking comment on the nation’s readiness for a possible explosion of coronavirus cases.\n“We are likely to need more,” a National Health Service spokesman told Reuters. “Engineers have already been tasked with developing plans to produce more ventilators in the UK, at speed.”\nHamilton CEO Wieland is skeptical, however, of the British government’s recent call for manufacturers from other industries including Ford, Honda and Rolls Royce to help make equipment including ventilators.\n“I wish them the best of luck,” Wieland said. “I do not believe anything will come of it. These devices are very complex. It takes us four to five years” to develop a new product.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)\n* GRAPHIC: ICE Newcastle coal vs. SGX Indonesia coal: reut.rs/3bmYOzG\nBy Clyde Russell\nLAUNCESTON, Australia, March 26 (Reuters) - Asia’s seaborne coal market is increasingly diverging between higher-quality Australian coal, where prices are holding up despite the economic shock being caused by the coronavirus, and lower-quality Indonesian fuel, which is losing ground.\nThe price of Australian benchmark Newcastle thermal coal futures traded on the Intercontinental Exchange ended at $66.35 a tonne on Wednesday, down slightly from the prior day but up from the low so far this year of $65.15 on March 9.\nThe contract, which covers coal with an energy value of 6,000 kilocalories per kilogram (kcal/kg), has traded in a fairly narrow band so far this year, and at the close on Wednesday was only 2% weaker than at the end of last year.\nThis is despite the massive disruption caused to the economy of China, the world’s biggest coal importer, in the wake of the spread of the coronavirus from its origin in the city of Wuhan.\nWhile China has largely contained the virus, it has now spread across the globe, leading to increasingly strong isolation measures in many countries, with the concomitant economic fallout.\nHowever, futures for Indonesian coal with an energy rating of 4,200 kcal/kg traded in Singapore ended at $32.61 a tonne on Wednesday, the lowest price this year.\nThe contract is down 10.7% from its peak so far in 2020 of $36.51 a tonne on Feb. 10, and is also 4% softer than its close at the end of last year.\nWhat lies behind the divergence of the two main types of seaborne coal in Asia?\nThe most likely explanation is the current coronavirus crisis is changing market dynamics, rather than any structural change in supply or demand.\nIndonesia’s coal exports have been in a range around 30 million tonnes in recent months, with China and India accounting for about 60% of the total.\nAt the start of the year, both markets were performing well, with China actually importing more coal during its coronavirus lockdown, due to the impact on domestic mines and transport infrastructure.\nIndia’s imports from Indonesia were also resilient in the first two months of the year as coastal power plants increased generation, but they appear to be tapering off this month.\nIn the first 25 days of March just 4.04 million tonnes of Indonesian coal was discharged at Indian ports, according to vessel-tracking data compiled by Refinitiv.\nWhile that figure will rise by the end of month as more cargoes are unloaded, it looks certain that March’s total will be below February’s 7.96 million tonnes and January’s 7.42 million.\nIndia has lagged the rest of Asia in being hit by the coronavirus, but the country is now taking strong lockdown measures to prevent its spread, which will curb demand for electricity to power industry.\nCoal stocks at power plants and mines have also been rising, with the Business Standard newspaper reporting on March 24 that inventories were above 100 million tonnes, with stocks at plants reaching a record 41.4 million tonnes.\nPlentiful stocks combined with a sharp slowdown in economic activity mean India’s coal imports are likely to slip in coming months, especially from Indonesia.\nAustralia supplies virtually no thermal coal to India, which generally takes Indonesian coal because of its lower cost and cheaper freight rates. Australia’s trade with India is largely in coking coal used in steel-making.\nThe main markets for Australian thermal coal are China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, and Refinitiv data shows these markets have been resilient so far this year.\nTogether these four markets imported 26.8 million tonnes of both thermal and coking coal from Australia in January, the most since July last year, while February’s total was 21.22 million, up from 20.1 million in the same month last year.\nWith the coronavirus outbreak seemingly contained in China and Taiwan, and progress being made in Japan and South Korea, it’s possible that their imports of coal will hold up in coming months, with the main risk being the economic downturn in the rest of the world.\nAssuming no shock to supply should mines be forced to close in Australia to combat the coronavirus, there is a case that prices shouldn’t decline too much, but it would be difficult to make a bullish case until the world economy is showing signs of recovery.\nWith far greater exposure to India, Indonesian coal prices are more under threat, and will remain so until it’s clear that the world’s second-biggest importer of coal has beaten the coronavirus.

        "news_content_translate_en": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian researchers said on Tuesday they have mapped the immune responses from one of country’s first coronavirus patients, findings the health minister said were an important step in developing a vaccine and treatment.\nThe coronavirus has infected more than 168,000 people worldwide and killed at least 6,610, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\nWhile the bulk of those infected experience only mild symptoms, it is severe or critical in 20% of patients. The virus mortality rate is about 3.4%, the WHO has estimated.\nAs scientists scramble to develop a vaccine, researchers at Australia’s Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity said they had taken an important step in understanding the virus.\nBy examining the blood results from an unidentified woman in her 40s, they discovered that people’s immune systems respond to coronavirus in the same way it typically fights flu.\nThe findings help scientists understand why some patients recover while others develop more serious respiratory problems, the researchers said.\n“People can use our methods to understand the immune responses in larger COVID-19 cohorts, and also understand what’s lacking in those who have fatal outcomes,” said Katherine Kedzierska, professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Melbourne, which took part in the research. COVID-19 is the disease caused by the coronavirus.\nAs researchers monitored the Australian patient’s immune response, they were able to accurately predict when she would recover.\nResearchers did not name the patient, but said she was an Australian citizen who was evacuated out of Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak in China.\nHealth Minister Greg Hunt described the development as “world leading” and a major development in research on the disease.\n“It’s about fast-tracking a vaccine by identifying which candidates are most likely to be successful,” Hunt told reporters. “It’s also about fast-tracking potential therapies and treatments for patients who already have coronavirus.”\nAt least a dozen drugmakers around the world are working on vaccines or antiviral and other treatments for the fast-spreading contagion.\nBut investment costs for vaccines could run as high as $800 million in a process that, even if accelerated, will likely take more than a year until approval, according to executives from companies involved in the effort.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "(Reuters) - U.S. researchers, following the lead of scientists in other countries, have launched studies to see whether widely-available, low-cost generic drugs can be used to help treat the illness caused by the new coronavirus.\nThere are currently no vaccines or treatments for the highly-contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness, so patients can only receive supportive care for now.\nBut a 1,500-person trial, led by the University of Minnesota, began this week to see whether malaria treatment  hydroxychloroquine can prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19. Two other trials are studying the blood pressure drug losartan as a possible treatment for the disease.\nThe malaria drug, also being tested in China, Australia and France, was touted earlier this week by Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, who recovered from malaria in 2000 after taking the medication.\nBesides having a direct antiviral effect, hydroxychloroquine suppresses the production and release of proteins involved in the inflammatory complications of several viral diseases.\n“We are trying to leverage the science to see if we can do something in addition to minimizing contacts,” said Dr. Jakub Tolar, dean of the University of Minnesota Medical School and vice president for clinical affairs. “Results are likely in weeks, not months.”\nMost people infected with the new coronavirus develop only mild flu-like symptoms, but around 20 percent can have more severe disease that can lead to pneumonia requiring hospitalization.\nThe fast-spreading virus, which emerged in China in December and is now in more than 150 countries, has infected more than 214,000 and killed over 8,700 people worldwide, including at least 145 in the United States. Experts say it could take a year or more to have a preventive vaccine ready, so effective treatments are desperately needed.\nA French team on Tuesday said initial results from a 24-patient trial of hydroxychloroquine showed that 25% of patients given the drug still carried the coronavirus after six days, compared with 90% of patients given a placebo.\nTolar said he bought 1,500 doses of hydroxychloroquine for a “laughable” amount of money. “We don’t need a multibillion-dollar investment. It is part of the beauty of this approach,” he said.\nBut he and others cautioned that people should not be using any prescription drugs without medical oversight.\n“These treatments should be used only in hospitals by critical care specialists,” said Dr. Russel Buhr, critical care pulmonologist at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nAlso this week, the University of Minnesota launched two trials testing losartan - one to measure whether the hypertension drug reduces the risk of organ failure for COVID-19 patients who have been hospitalized, and another looking at whether the drug can limit the need for hospitalizations.\nLosartan is an angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blocker, which  researchers say could play a role in blocking an enzyme used by the virus to bind to cells.\nPharmaceutical companies are also working to develop treatments for COVID-19, including Gilead Sciences Inc’s experimental antiviral drug remdesivir, which is given to hospitalized patients via intravenous infusion over several days.\nThe New England Journal of Medicine earlier this month described how the drug was successfully used on the first patient infected by the novel coronavirus in the United States.\nResults from a remdesivir trial in China could come early next month, while Gilead has begun two international trials of the drug that previously failed as a potential Ebola treatment. And the National Institutes of Health last month began testing it on patients in a U.S. trial.\n“We are focusing on high risk patients,” said Dr. Andre Kalil, infectious disease specialist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and the U.S. trial’s lead investigator. “Our hope is that remdesivir will show that patients will be improving faster.”\nCompanies including Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, Eli Lilly and Co and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co have begun to develop coronavirus treatment candidates, but human testing of their drugs has not yet started.\nAnti-inflammatory drugs, like Regeneron’s Kevzara and Roche Holding AG’s Actemra, have been used to treat the lung inflammation caused by COVID-19.\nBut in a disappointment, Chinese investigators reported this week that Kaletra, a combination HIV drug sold by AbbVie, failed to improve outcomes for seriously ill COVID-19 patients.\n",

The Olympic Games are scheduled to start in Tokyo on July 24. \"For now, All England Championships hasn't been cancelled yet, everything is going on well, but the coronavirus is spreading very quickly. At the end of the day, I will adhere to the government's decision on what needs to be done,\" Sindhu said on Thursday.\"It (coronavirus) has just come out and has become too much now. It's a bad thing to happen in an Olympic year. Few of the tournaments have been cancelled, so we will have to wait and see what happens,\" she added.Her mentor and national coach Pulella Gopichand said even though an event like the Olympics is a once-in-a-lifetime experience for a sportsperson but health and well-being of people should always be the top priority.\"In none of the other Games, Commonwealth, Asian Games or World Championships, we have seen this kind of thing. For us, Olympics comes in four years and is a lifetime opportunity. So people prepare, plan and live their dream,\" he said.\"I think at the end of the day it is very important to understand and recognise the fact that life is important and sport is only a part of life and sometimes in our focus we tend to lose the perspective.\"If things go well the Olympics will happen but if they don't, I think the priority is to ensure the safety and health of the citizens.\"The coronavirus, which was first detected in Wuhan, China, is spreading fast and has so far led to over 3,000 deaths while infecting nearly 100,000 across the world. China, Italy, Korea, Japan and Iran are among the worst hit by the deadly disease.\"We are facing difficulties in going out of the country for training. Travel bans have been put in place for many countries which is hampering our preparation,\" one of India's top medal hopes in wrestling, Bajrang Punia said.\"We are going to Russia for training but some wrestlers are nervous after the Asian Olympic Qualifier was cancelled.\"The three-time world championship medallist grappler, however, urged people not to press the panic button just yet.\"I haven't made any changes in my lifestyle. I don't think people should panic too much,\" Bajrang said.\"As an athlete, I will continue my preparations without thinking about whether the Olympics will be postponed or not. It's up to the organisers and IOC to take a call.\"The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Tokyo Games organisers have asserted that the event will be held as per schedule despite coronavirus concerns. Seasoned shooter Sanjeev Rajput, who has already booked his Olympic quota, is hopeful that the Olympics will be held smoothly despite admitting that the situation is not exactly good in terms of preparation. \"Preparations are indirectly affected as our main plan was to go to South Korea for the Test event which is going to happen in the same range as the one to be used in the Olympics. But now we will be training for the same Test event in India and I hope the Test event takes place,\" he said.\"I have hope that it (Olympics) will be held as per schedule, same time, same venue. Still it's 4-5 months away, we can expect some good news by then that COVID-19 is shrinking.\"India's sprint ace Dutee Chand, who is yet to qualify for the Tokyo Games, said an event like the Olympics can't be held if majority of the competing nations decide to skip because of the virus.\"My job is to run, so it is up to the government to decide whether to send me abroad for training or not. My three competitions abroad have been cancelled. I had booked my tickets but didn't get visa due to coronavirus,\" she said.\"The virus started from China but now has spread all over the world. So, if the situation remains the same then it will be a threat for all athletes. \"Olympics is a big event and it cannot be held if 26 or 27 countries decide not to participate.\"\n",

Sonchon is above Pyongyang, near the northwest corner of the Korean peninsula.\n\"Such military action by North Korea is highly inappropriate at a time when Covid-19 is causing difficulties worldwide,\" the JCS said, calling for an \"immediate stop\".\nThe missile launch came just hours after North Korea confirmed it would go ahead with a session of the Supreme People's Assembly, its rubber-stamp legislature, in Pyongyang.\nAs an event that gathers almost 700 of the country's top officials in one spot, analysts said it was a show of strength amid the virus outbreak.\n\"If it goes ahead, it would be the ultimate show of (North Korea's) confidence in managing the coronavirus situation,\" Rachel Minyoung Lee, of the North Korea monitoring website NK News, said on Twitter this week.\nNorth Korea has not reported any confirmed cases of the coronavirus, though a top US military official said last week he is \"fairly certain\" there were infections in North Korea.\nIt has imposed strict border controls, but is viewed by aid organisations as especially vulnerable to an outbreak as its health system lacks resources and because of international sanctions.\n\"Not only does Pyongyang wish to avoid signs of weakness during the coronavirus crisis, it wants its people to believe that North Korea stands in a position of relative strength,\" said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.\n\"Kim can improve military capabilities ... at little cost because international aid is unlikely to be cancelled after these tests, China and Russia refuse to tighten sanctions, and the US and South Korea are focused on defense cost-sharing negotiations and Covid-19.\"\nSaturday's missile launch followed two incidents earlier this month, when North Korea launched short-range missiles and multiple projectiles according to South Korea's military, drawing US and Chinese appeals for Pyongyang to return to talks on ending its nuclear and missile programmes.\nState media KCNA also said on Saturday North Korean leader Kim Jong Un guided an artillery fire competition between combined units of the North Korean army on Friday, issuing photos of him watching with high-ranking military officers, all unmasked.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "By the end of Thursday, there could be over 2 lakh patients down with novel coronavirus infection. The 58th report by the World Health Organisation (WHO) put the number of Covid-19 patients at 1,91,127 as of March 18. This includes 7,807 deaths. The WHO says the whole world is a \"very high\" risk zone for novel coronavirus spread. But there is hope on the horizon.\nTo begin with a data set. There are just eight countries which have reported more than 50 deaths due to complications induced by Covid-19, the disease caused by novel coronavirus. These are China, Italy, Iran, Spain, France, South Korea, the UK and the US. These countries collectively account for 7,582 deaths. Of these countries, China is increasingly showing lesser number of fresh cases. Same is the case with South Korea.\nChina has, in fact, closed down its last special medical facility for Covid-19 treatment. The images of health workers removing protective masks are being widely circulated on social media. This was the temporary hospital put in place to accommodate the overflow of novel coronavirus patients. Now, not enough new cases are being reported to keep it operational.\nChina's health commission on Thursday reported no new domestic case of novel coronavirus infection. The health commission said there were 34 new cases of novel coronavirus in China but all were imported or overseas cases. It was the first time that China did not report a domestic coronavirus case since its outbreak was recognised in January. On previous two days, China reported just one domestic case each.\nBusinesses are coming into operation again in China. Apple has opened its stores in China after a month-long shutdown.\nAnother good news coming is the recovery of two key patients - the oldest and the youngest. The oldest patient was a 103-year-old Chinese woman and the youngest was a newborn in the UK. Both have now been reported to have recovered from the fatal infection.\nThe doctors from different parts of the world including India have been successful in finding a combination of drugs that can actually treat Covid-19, a disease that is only two-month old for the medical fraternity. The central government in India has allowed a combination of drugs used to treat HIV patients to treat those having Covid-19.\nIn the US, novel coronavirus vaccine has been used in its first clinical trial. Israel is too very close to announcing another vaccine. India has also begun researching on the coronavirus strand isolated by doctors here.\nIn India, the patients of novel coronavirus are recovering well. Given the efficiency with which hospitals have attended to the Covid-19 patients make the three deaths due to novel coronavirus aberrations. First of the three who died had refused to go by the medical advice given to him.\nFurther, the R-naught or the number of persons being infected by a Covid-19 patient or carrier is much lower than what has been found in source region of China or hot zone like Italy. Against the average R-naught of over 2, it is only 1.7 in India. This could be due to efficient management of the pandemic or restricted testing regime, as some have expressed concern about, for novel coronavirus.\nThe WHO has said it is \"impressed\" with India's response to novel coronavirus pandemic. WHO representative to India Henk Bekedam has, however, said that India needs to widen its scope and reach of lab testing for novel coronavirus. The government has already announced including atypical pneumonia patients in the ambit of the lab testing for novel coronavirus.\nThis may or may not lead to spike in the fresh cases of novel coronavirus in India. But relief for India is the difference in pattern of how the disease spread in hot zone of Italy, Iran, Spain, France or even the United States - all much more industrially advanced countries than India. These countries reported more than 500 cases only three days after reaching three figure mark.\nThere has been an increased consciousness in the public about social distancing and not spreading rumours despite some attempts which were quickly marked by agencies including the WHO. People have cancelled their travel, curtailed their social gatherings and companies encouraged employees to work from home to mitigate chances of contracting the contagion in transport.\nThe railways told a parliamentary panel on Wednesday that 60 per cent of booked tickets were cancelled in March under the shadow of novel coronavirus outbreak in India. This means a loss of revenue for the government but it also signals the increased awareness and cooperation on part of the public to defeat the pandemic.

        "news_content_translate_en": "With three deaths and 148 cases of coronavirus in 48 days the bulk of them over the last few days experience from other affected countries indicates that India may be on the verge of a massive outbreak.\nData shows the deadly virus took 33 days to infect five people in India and just 15 more days to infect another 143. Similarly, Pakistan reported five cases in the first six days, and a whopping 236 in the next 11 days. South Korea reported a little more than 100 cases in the first 29 days, and the number crossed 7,000 in the next 16 days.\nThe question is why South Asian countries, including India, have reported fewer cases in comparison to other countries? India Today Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) deep-dived beyond the confirmed cases to quantify the spread of coronavirus. The official figures are suspected to be only the tip of the iceberg of a much wider outbreak in these countries.\nHow the outbreak grew over time\nThe COVID-19 was first detected in December last year in China's Wuhan city. John Hopkins University data shows that the spread of coronavirus was slower in the first few days and rose exponentially over the next 10-15 days on an average.\nIn India, the first coronavirus case was reported in Kerala on January 30. Within 33 days of the first case being reported, the number of infected people rose to five. In the next 15 days, the deadly COVID-19 infected another 143 and killed three people across the country.\nThe chart shows cases are compounding very fast and almost out of control in countries such as Italy, South Korea and Iran. These countries failed to take precautionary measure in their initial phase. South Korea has now started an aggressive screening policy.\nJohn, who had chaired India's expert advisory group, further said, If the standard of care is not as good as in other countries, our case fatality rate will be higher.\nThe number of infections is rising rapidly in India. At present, the death to case ratio is 2.10, which is slightly lower than the WHO’s recent estimate (3.4 per cent). Case Fatality Rate or mortality rate is calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the number of officially confirmed cases.\nBased on the experience of H1N1-virus cases, John illustrated the worst-case scenario for COVID-19. Out of the total 1.3 billion population, 80 crore are adults. If 10 per cent adults get infected (around 8 crore) and 10 per cent among them develop severe illness (80 lakh) in particular, the elderly, those with diabetes, chronic lung diseases, etc., who are more vulnerable 80,000 may die at a 1 per cent case fatality rate, and 1,60,000 at a 2 per cent case fatality rate, all in one year.\nIn India, most coronavirus cases are imported, and the government has also focused on foreign-returnees. As of March 18, more than 13 lakh passengers have been screened at airports. But doubts remain about those who have come in contact with these people as they might be the missing link of \"official cases\".\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "在48天内有3人死亡，148例冠状病毒病例，其中大部分在过去几天内来自其他受影响国家的经验表明，印度可能处于大规模爆发的边缘。\n数据显示，这种致命的病毒在印度用了33天时间感染了5个人，而在印度又用了15天时间感染了143人。同样，巴基斯坦在头6天报告了5起病例，在接下来的11天里报告了236起。韩国在前29天报告了略多于100例的病例，在接下来的16天里，这个数字超过了7000例。\n问题是，为什么包括印度在内的南亚国家报告的病例比其他国家少？今天，印度数据情报局（DIU）深入到确诊病例之外，以量化冠状病毒的传播。官方数据被怀疑只是这些国家更广泛疫情的冰山一角。\n随着时间的推移疫情是如何发展的\nCOVID-19于去年12月在中国武汉市首次被发现。约翰·霍普金斯大学的数据显示，冠状病毒在最初几天的传播速度较慢，在接下来的10-15天内平均呈指数增长。\n在印度，1月30日在喀拉拉邦报告了第一例冠状病毒病例。在报告第一例病例的33天内，感染人数上升到5人。在接下来的15天里，致命的COVID-19又感染了143人，造成全国3人死亡。\n图表显示，在意大利、韩国和伊朗等国，案件的复合速度非常快，几乎失控。这些国家在最初阶段没有采取预防措施。韩国现在已经开始了一项积极的筛选政策。\n曾担任印度专家咨询小组主席的约翰进一步表示，如果医疗水平不如其他国家，我们的病死率将更高。\n印度的感染人数正在迅速上. 目前，死亡率为2.10，略低于世卫组织最近的估计（3.4%）。病死率或死亡率是通过死亡人数除以官方确认的病例数来计算的。\n根据H1N1病毒病例的经验，John给出了COVID-19的最坏情况。在13亿人口中，80亿是成年人。如果10%的成年人受到感染（约8千万欧元），其中10%特别是老年人、糖尿病患者、慢性肺病患者等患上严重疾病（8000万欧元），则更脆弱的8万人可能在一年内以1%的病死率死亡，以2%的病死率死亡16万人。\n在印度，大多数冠状病毒病例是进口的，政府也把重点放在了外国返回者身上。截至3月18日，已有130多万名乘客在机场接受了安检。但对那些接触过这些人的人仍有疑虑，因为他们可能是“官司”中缺失的一环",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The medical impact of the new coronavirus is coming into sharper focus as it continues its spread in what is now officially recognized as a pandemic.\nIts true fatality rate isn't yet known, but it seems 10 times higher than the flu, which kills hundreds of thousands around the world each year, the United States' top infectious disease expert told lawmakers last week.\nMost people have had mild to moderate illness and recovered, but the virus is more serious for those who are older or have other health problems.\nThat's a huge number, said Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who now heads a global health organization. In the U.S., 60% of adults have at least one underlying health condition and 42% have two or more.\n\"There's still a lot that we don't know\" about the virus and disease it causes, COVID-19, he said.\nHOW IT SPREADS\nMost spread is from droplets produced when an infected person coughs, which are inhaled by people nearby. Transmission from touching contaminated surfaces hasn't been shown yet, though recent tests by U.S. scientists suggest it's possible -- one reason they recommend washing your hands and not touching your face.\nThe virus can live in the air for several hours, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. Cleaning surfaces with solutions containing diluted bleach should kill it.\n\"While we are still learning about the biology of this virus, it does not appear that there is a major risk of spread through sweat,\" said Julie Fischer, a Georgetown University microbiologist. The biggest concern about going to the gym is infected people coughing on others, or contaminating shared surfaces or equipment, she said. Consider avoiding large classes and peak hours and don't go if you're coughing or feverish, she suggests.\nThe risk of virus transmission from food servers is the same risk as transmission from other infected people, but \"one of the concerns in that food servers, like others facing stark choices about insurance and paychecks, may be pressured to work even if they are sick,\" she said.\nHOW FAST DOES IT SPREAD?\nEach infected person spreads to two or three others on average, researchers estimate. It spreads more easily than flu but less than measles, tuberculosis or some other respiratory diseases. It is not known if it spreads less easily among children, but fewer of them have been diagnosed with the disease. A study of 1,099 patients in China found that 0.9% of the cases were younger than 15.\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\nMost people get fever and cough, sometimes fatigue or shortness of breath, and recover after about two weeks. About 15% develop severe disease, including pneumonia, Chinese scientists reported from 45,000 cases there. Symptoms usually start slowly and often worsen as the illness goes on.\nIn a report last week on the first 12 patients in the U.S., seven were hospitalized; most had underlying health problems and got worse during the second week of illness.\nIn China, slightly more males have been diagnosed with COVID-19 than females, which might be because roughly half of Chinese men smoke but only 5% of females do, Frieden said.\nChildren seem to get less sick -- a report on 10 in China found that fevers tended to be milder and they lacked clear signs of pneumonia.\nWHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE?\nSome cruise ship passengers described symptoms similar to the common cold or flu.\n\"It's been a 2 on a scale of 10,\" said Carl Goldman, who was hospitalized in Omaha, Nebraska, after flying home.\nHowever, a Chinese postgraduate student described going to the hospital twice after her symptoms worsened, and feeling \"a heavy head while walking, unable to breathe, and nauseous.\"\nWHAT'S THE TEST LIKE?\nThe CDC recommends at least two swabs -- nose and throat. Samples are sent to labs that look for bits of viral genetic material, which takes roughly 4 to 6 hours. Altogether, it can take several days to ship a sample and get results back.\nIt's been taking two to three days, and \"we are working really hard to see if we can shorten that time\" by developing an in-house test, Dr. Aimee Moulin of the University of California, Davis said Thursday in a conference call held by the American College of Emergency Physicians.\nSome areas have opened drive-thru sites for testing, which could reduce exposure to health workers and other patients or the public.\nWHEN IS THE VIRUS MOST CONTAGIOUS?\nThe average time from exposure to developing symptoms is five to six days, but can be up to two weeks. Tests have found high amounts of virus in the throats and noses of people a couple days before they show symptoms.\nSigns of virus also have been found in stool weeks after patients recover, but that doesn't mean it's capable of causing illness, scientists warn.\n\"The virus can be degraded,\" said Robert Webster, a St. Jude Children's Research Center virus expert. \"It's not necessarily infectious virus at all.\"\nHOW DEADLY IS IT?\nThat won't be known until large studies are done to test big groups of people to see how many have been infected and with or without symptoms.\nScientists have estimated the fatality rate from less than 1% to as high as 4% among cases diagnosed so far, depending on location.\nFlu kills about 0.1% of those it infects, so the new virus seems about 10 times more lethal, the National Institutes of Health's Dr. Anthony Fauci told Congress last week.\nThe death rate has been higher among people with other health problems -- more than 10% for those with heart disease, for example. In the U.S., 30 million have diabetes, more than 70 million are obese and nearly 80 million have high blood pressure.\nCAN INFECTED PEOPLE WHO RECOVER GET IT AGAIN?\nIt's not known. A few reports from China say some people had COVID-19, recovered and then fell ill again. It's unclear if that's a relapse, a new infection, or a case where the person never fully recovered in the first place.\nScientists at the at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle say the 30,000-letter genetic code of the virus changes by one letter every 15 days. It's not known how many of these changes would be needed for the virus to seem different enough to the immune system of someone who had a previous version of it for it to cause a fresh infection.\nFauci told Congress on Thursday that it was unlikely that someone could get reinfected.\n\"We haven't formally proved it, but it is strongly likely that that's the case,\" he said. \"Because if this acts like any other virus, once you recover, you won't get reinfected.\"\nWILL IT GO AWAY IN THE SUMMER?\nFlu fades each spring and the new virus may do the same, Fauci said last week in a podcast with a journal editor.\n\"I am hoping that as we get into the warmer weather we will see a decline that will give us a chance to get our preparedness up to speed,\" Fauci said.\nBut that, too, is far from certain. \"We have to assume that the virus will continue to have the capacity to spread, and it's a false hope to say yes, it will just disappear in the summertime like influenza,\" said Dr. Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization's emergencies chief.\nFlu viruses also mutate quickly, requiring new vaccines to be made each year. If the coronavirus follows suit, Frieden said, \"It could become a virus that circulates around the world for many years to come.\"\n",

This would to allow people and organisations to contribute to help fund masks, gloves, gowns and goggles for heath workers, as well as diagnostic kits and investment in research and development, including for vaccines.\nFacebook (FB.O) will match up to $10 million in donations, while Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google will donate $5 million, the WHO and UN Foundation later announced in a joint statement.\nSocial distancing, where people avoid close proximity or touching, is a \"tried and tested method\" to slow the spread of a virus but \"not a panacea\" that will stop transmission, the WHO's top emergency expert Dr. Mike Ryan said.\nEach country must decide on its own measures to protect its population, Ryan said, adding: \"But we've also consistently said that blanket travel measures in their own right will do nothing to protect an individual state.\"\n\"Detection and isolation of infected people, as well as tracing their contacts and wider testing, must be part of a comprehensive strategy,\" Ryan said.\n\"As part of an overall comprehensive strategy, there is a place - particularly inside national borders - for potentially restricting movement between zones, as we've seen in certain places,\" Ryan said.\n\"But there is rarely a justification for blanket bans, unless of course the context and the risk defines that,\" Ryan said.\nUS President Donald Trump has announced sweeping travel restrictions to prevent people from 26 European countries -- except for Britain and Ireland -- from travelling to the United States in a bid to limit the virus spread.\nA number of other countries in recent days have announced stepped-up border checks, and cancelled flights to other countries, in an effort to contain the spread.\nTrump on Friday declared a national emergency over the fast-spreading coronavirus, opening the door to providing what he said was about $50 billion in federal aid to fight the disease.\n",

While there is no conclusive way to quantify the effect of restricted human activity, its imprint on atmosphere is somewhat measurable.\nScientists have observed a pattern which links a decreased level of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), first over China and now over Italy, since the implementation of mass quarantines.\nNitrogen dioxide is usually emitted into the atmosphere as a result of human activities such as motor vehicles, power plants, and industrial facilities.\nBoth National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) and European Space Agency (ESA) experts link the decrease in NO2 levels with an effective decrease in machine-run activities in these areas.\nWHAT ABOUT INDIA?\nIndia has taken several steps to contain the spreading of the novel coronavirus - state governments as well as Union governments have issued multiple advisories and orders to restrict community spread, as much as possible.\nBelow are NO2 levels on February 7.\nBelow are NO2 levels on March 16,\nMost administrations have ordered closing educational institutions, cinema halls and cancelled sporting events.\nWhile there are no strict orders against domestic movements and industrial gatherings, the government has advised citizens to avoid travel and meetings.\nEven Prime Minister Narendra Modi has encouraged people to work from home.\nHowever, satellite data from the ESA show that there is negligible reduction in NO2 levels.\nThe data was collected between February 17 to March 16, 2020. This shows that despite all the advisories, the reduction in overall outdoor human activities in India has not been enough to leave a large imprint in the atmosphere.\nThis, however, may not be the exact assessment of all the activities happening on the ground, but it gives a sense of a quantifiable changes caused in the atmosphere due to large-scale human activities. Although, the situation in India is nowhere similar to that in China or Europe, these governments along with those of the UK and USA have been criticised for not taking similar measures sooner.\nWhen it comes to the novel coronavirus outbreak, the global science community has reached a consensus that no step is enough and preemptive measures are more effective in these situations.\nWhile experts world over are advising the governments to take more drastic measures to contain the outbreak into new areas, large-scale isolation and absence of public gatherings have shown effective results.\n",

The United Arab Emirates announced it was closing all schools for four weeks.\nThe death toll in Italy, Europe's hardest-hit country, jumped to 79 on Tuesday and Italian officials are considering expanding the area under quarantine. France reported its fourth coronavirus death, while Indonesia, Ukraine, Argentina and Chile reported their first coronavirus cases.\nAbout 3.4% of confirmed cases of COVID-19 have died, far above seasonal flu's fatality rate of under 1%, but the virus can be contained, the WHO chief said on Tuesday.\n\"To summarize, COVID-19 spreads less efficiently than flu, transmission does not appear to be driven by people who are not sick, it causes more severe illness than flu, there are not yet any vaccines or therapeutics, and it can be contained,\" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva.\nHealth officials have said the death rate is 2% to 4% depending on the country and may be much lower if there are thousands of unreported mild cases of the disease.\nSince the coronavirus outbreak, prices of surgical masks have increased sixfold, N95 respirators have tripled in cost and protective gowns cost twice as much, the WHO said.\nIt estimates healthcare workers each month will need 89 million masks, 76 million gloves and 1.6 million pairs of goggles.\nThe coronavirus, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, has spread around the world, with more new cases now appearing outside China than inside.\nThere are almost 91,000 cases globally of which more than 80,000 are in China. China's death toll was 2,946, with more than 166 fatalities elsewhere.\nIn a unanimous decision, the Fed said it was cutting rates by a half percentage point to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%.\nFinance ministers from the G7 group of rich countries were ready to take action, including fiscal measures where appropriate, Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said. Central banks would continue to support price stability and economic growth.\nAGGRESSIVE CONTAINMENT\nIn the United States, there are now over 100 people in at least a dozen states with the coronavirus and nine deaths, all in the Seattle area.\nAmid criticism of Americans not being able to get tested for coronavirus unless they met certain limited criteria, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Tuesday that anyone can now get tested with a doctor's order under new guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nNew York state reported its second case, a man in his 50s who works in Manhattan and has been hospitalized.\nThe public transportation agency in New York, the most densely populated major U.S. city of more than 8 million, said on Twitter it was deploying \"enhanced sanitizing procedures\" for stations, train cars, buses and certain vehicles.\nChina has seen coronavirus cases fall sharply, with 129 in the last 24 hours the lowest reported since Jan. 20.\nWith the world's second largest economy struggling to get back on track, China is increasingly concerned about the virus being brought back into the country by citizens returning from new hotspots elsewhere.\nTravelers entering Beijing from South Korea, Japan, Iran and Italy would have to be quarantined for 14 days, a city official said. Shanghai has introduced a similar order.\nThe worst outbreak outside China is in South Korea, where President Moon Jae-in declared war on the virus, ordering additional hospital beds and more masks as cases rose by 600 to nearly 5,000, with 34 deaths.\nWHO officials also expressed concerns about the situation in Iran, saying doctors lacked respirators and ventilators needed for patients with severe cases.\nWHO emergency program head Michael Ryan said the need in Iran was \"more acute\" than for other countries.\nWhile the case numbers in Iran appear to be bad, he said, \"things tend to look worse before getting better.\"\nThe International Olympic Committee on Tuesday said the summer games in Tokyo set to begin on July 24 were still expected to happen despite Japan having nearly 1,000 coronavirus cases and 12 deaths.

And with the arrival of the coronavirus in Brazil, with a confirmation this Wednesday in Sao Paulo, Antarctica becomes the only continent without cases. This has entered a new phase in which Covid-19 is already spreading more rapidly around the world than in China.\nEven if the acceleration of the outbreak is causing concern within the European Union (EU), the situation is not, for the moment, cause for panic: the EU has again ensured on Tuesday that it is working \"on all fronts\" to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus in Europe, insisting on the need for coordination of the Member States \"in real time\" to tackle a phenomenon that is \"dynamic\".\nThe European Commission has reinforced that the key is for the EU as a whole to be \"ready\" for a possible increase in the epidemic, both in terms of treatment and in terms of containing the outbreak. One of the most sensitive issues linked to increased cases, particularly the situation in Italy, is border control, which the Commission has emphasised is not within its competence, but that of each Member State. However, such a scenario is not discarded either.\nItaly is the country most concerned by the European health authorities. This is because there has been a sudden increase in positive cases since Friday: only three people infected with the virus were accounted for on that day, but that number has since risen to 400 infected. This Wednesday was also confirmed as the twelfth victim in the country.\nThe Italian authorities are increasingly trying to tighten the siege on Covid-19: the containment measures announced this weekend for ten locations where they live for around fifty thousand people remain in forcYeah. V, Piedmont and Lombardy in northern Italy are the critical regions located in the red zone.\nFor the time being, the death pattern in Italy is similar to that in China. Older people with associated diseases, such a s cancer, diabetes, respiratory diseases and others that depress the immune system, are being most affected.\nAfter Italy, Germany remains the European country with the most cases, but without new infections. France has already confirmed a total of 17 infected in the country and a second fatality: a 60-year-old French man died at dawn in Paris after being diagnosed. Norway, Austria, Croatia, Switzerland, Spain, Northern Macedonia and Greece have also confirmed new cases of infection.\nSo far, the only known case of a Portuguese infected by the new virus is that of Adriano Maranh o, the crewman of a cruise ship who was admitted to a Japanese hospital in Okazaki, about thirty miles from Tokyo. All suspected cases detected in Portugal (until this Wednesday were 18) were negative.\nThe virus that has already made more than 2760 dead (most of them in China) is now spreading at the highest speed around the world and there are already people infected in more than 40 countries. In addition to deaths in mainland China, victims are reported in Iran, South Korea, Italy, Japan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, France and Taiwan.\nThis Wednesday, China reported 52 deaths, the smallest daily increase in three weeks, while reporting 406 new cases, most in Hubei province. The number of new patients thus recorded a fall of 20%, compared to Monday, for example. According to the updated data by the Chinese National Health Commission, the country is adding more than 2700 dead and 78 thousand confirmed cases. Among the infected, more than 45 thousand were still active and more than 8500 patients were in serious condition. On the other hand, almost thirty thousand people have already been releaseYeah.\nAlthough Iran is the country with the most deaths from the new coronavirus after China, 139 cases of infection have been reported only last week and 19 people have died, President Hassan Rouhani said his government is not planning to quarantine cities and districts of the country.\nHowever, the authorities have already closed schools and some universities and admit to extending this decision for a few more days. There are also plans to restrict access to Shiite sacred sites this Friday. On the other hand, 11 countries have already \"closed\" their land and air borders with Iran (neighbouring Iraq, Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Armenia, and other countries in the region such a s Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Oman and Georgia).\nAvoiding panic is one of the key messages from the World Health Organisation (WHO): the organisation's public health director, Maria Neira, assured this Wednesday that it is \"irrational and disproportionate\" that masks and disinfectants are exhausted in pharmacies for fear of coronavirus. In statements to the Spanish broadcaster RAC-1, Neira recalled that masks are for the use of health personnel and stressed that the decrease of victims and diseases occurring in China \"may mean that the epidemic has reached the summit and reached the epidemic peak\". On the other hand, Bruce Aylward, the specialist who led the WHO team sent to China, warned that the planet is \"not ready\" to face a pandemic of this new coronavirus.\nAs for the preparation of our country, the Foreign Minister, has assured us that we are prepared for a possible entry of the Covid-19 coronavirus. Augusto Santos Silva mentioned this Wednesday that there is a contingency plan ready to be activated in Portugal. However, it stressed that this is a global problem requiring concerted action, mainly at European levelYeah.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nAs already announced, Portugal is strengthening prevention measures and the network of available laboratories and hospitals to receive suspected cases of infection with the new coronavirus. In terms of future measures, the Portuguese Government does not rule out the closure of borders, but has strengthened that it will only do so together with the European Union, in line with the intentions of the European Commission.\nThe pneumologist and coordinator of the crisis office of the Order of Physicians, Filipe Froes, said this Wednesday to Lusa that, compared to the response capacity for influenza A ten years ago, there is now \"less hospital response capacity, less human resources and less differentiation\". \"The challenge will be much greater, but it must also be adjusted to the transmission of the disease, to the number of Portuguese affected and to gravity,\" he said, stressing that \"the challenge at this time is still unknown\"",

Malaysia, with the highest number of infections in Southeast Asia at 2,161, has had 26 deaths.  \n The situation in the Philippines is similar to that in Indonesia, the region's most populous country, where there is an even higher ratio of deaths to detected cases - an indicator for doctors that the number of infections may be much higher.  \n Former Health Minister Esperanza Cabral said the reported infection rate was probably just the tip of the iceberg, given the Philippines has so far only tested 2,147 people.  \n \"We cannot gauge the extent of the outbreak until we have tested about 10,000 to 20,000 people,\" Cabral told Reuters.  \n Testing in the Philippines is to be ramped up with the arrival of 100,000 test kits from China.  \n Modelling from the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford suggests the number of infections in the Philippines may already be higher than 11,000.  \n  \n LOCKDOWN  \n The Philippines took drastic measures to contain the spread after its first domestic case on March 7, becoming the third country after China and Italy to put its people under home quarantine, suspend transport, work and commercial activity. [nL4N2B935Q] [nL4N2BG1HE]  \n But the health system is weak.  \n The Philippines, which on average sends 19,000 trained nurses overseas each year, has 10 beds and 14 doctors per 10,000 people, according to data from the World Health Organization. Italy has more than 40 doctors and 30 beds per 10,000 people.  \n An emergency ward worker who spoke to Reuters described patients waiting up to six hours to be seen and inexperienced staff treating critical patients due to manpower shortages.  \n Nine medical workers have died, and hundreds more have been quarantined for being close to sufferers.  \n The University of Santo Tomas hospital has 530 staff quarantined. The Chinese General Hospital and Medical Centre said it had insufficient testing kits and protective gear and could not take more coronavirus patients.  \n Under pressure from 11 private hospitals, the government has now dedicated three public hospitals to serve as special COVID-19 treatment centres - but they themselves are also under strain.  \n \"We have every reason to be scared,\" the private hospitals said in a letter appealing for help.  \n The head of the emergency department of St. Luke's Medical Centre, Richard Enecilla, said it had received 120 possible coronavirus-related patients in one day, and made them line up on the hospital driveway to limit exposure.  \n \"The way it exploded caught a lot us off-guard,\" he told Reuters. \"The volume of cases went up and our capacity to serve went down at the same time.\" REUTERS \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Older malaria drugs are being studied, and in some cases used, to treat or try to prevent infection with the new coronavirus, even though there is no firm evidence to show they are effective. Studies are underway in a number of countries, including China, France and the United States, to see whether the pills - chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine - may have a role to play in the rapidly spreading pandemic.  \n U.S. President Donald Trump has touted the malaria drugs as \"a game changer.\" But the Food and Drug Administration and other health experts said trials must first ensure the medicines are effective and safe for use in this patient population.  \n  \n WHY ARE MALARIA DRUGS UNDER CONSIDERATION?  \n There are currently no vaccines or U.S.-approved treatments for the highly contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness that has killed more than 18,000 worldwide, so even the most severely ill patients largely receive only supportive care such as breathing assistance.  \n On its website, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says some U.S. clinicians have reported anecdotal use of hydroxychloroquine at different doses.  \n Chloroquine is a synthetic form of quinine, which is found on the bark of the cinchona plant. It has been used for hundreds of years in South America to treat fever.  \n Chloroquine was first synthesized in the 1930s. A version called hydroxychloroquine, in use since the 1950s, is considered to be less toxic, according to studies. Both drugs can cause serious side effects, including vision loss, heart problems or even death, if used incorrectly.  \n The drugs are used to combat malaria, which is caused by a parasite spread through mosquito bites, because they interrupt its ability to digest a host's blood cells.  \n Scientists have detailed biochemical proprieties of chloroquine that indicate it could be used against some viral infections. These include direct antiviral effects, such as blocking steps needed by certain viruses to replicate, and its ability to suppress production and release of proteins involved in inflammatory complications of several viral diseases.  \n In addition to malaria, hydroxychloroquine is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.  \n  \n WHAT DOES THE DATA SAY?  \n Data has begun to emerge from some coronavirus trials, but most information so far is preliminary.  \n A French team last week said initial results from a 24-patient trial of hydroxychloroquine showed that 25% of patients given the drug still carried the coronavirus after six days, compared with 90% of patients given a placebo. But the trial is small and results on patient outcomes are still awaited.  \n Chinese researchers last month reported trial results showing that chloroquine treatment of COVID-19 patients had clinical and virologic benefit versus a comparison group. It has been added as a recommended treatment for the illness in China, where the virus first emerged in December.  \n This week, the Journal of Zhejiang University reported disappointing results from a 30-patient Shanghai study of hydroxychloroquine. It showed the drug worked no better than standard care for patients with COVID-19.  \n The University of Minnesota has launched a 1,500-person trial to see whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19 in people exposed to the virus - including healthcare workers and family members of infected people.  \n Other trials of the malaria drugs are ongoing or set to start in the United Kingdom, Norway and Thailand.  \n New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose state is the epicentre of the U.S. outbreak with more than 25,000 cases, on Sunday said it had acquired hundreds of thousands of doses of the malaria drugs to use in a clinical trial.  \n  \n IS THERE ENOUGH TO GO AROUND?  \n In the United States, prescriptions for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have already spiked and are in short supply, according to pharmacists.  \n Several makers of the generic medicines said they are increasing production of chloroquine pills. Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd, Mylan NV and Bayer AG have donated large quantities of the drugs to health authorities.  \n  \n PRESCRIPTION ONLY!  \n Health officials caution that no one should be taking these drugs to treat or prevent coronavirus infection without medical supervision and a prescription.  \n In Arizona, a man died and his wife was hospitalized after taking a nonmedical form of chloroquine used to fight parasites in aquariums.  \n \"Given the uncertainty around COVID-19, we understand that people are trying to find new ways to prevent or treat this virus, but self-medicating is not the way to do so,” said Dr. Daniel Brooks, medical director of the poison and drug information centre at Arizona-based Banner Health.

        "news_content_translate_en": "PARIS/WASHINGTON - Business activity collapsed from Australia, Japan and Western Europe to the United States at a record pace in March as measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic hammer the world economy, cementing economists' views of a deep global recession.  \n The highly contagious coronavirus, which causes a respiratory illness called COVID-19, has caused entire regions to be placed on lockdown and in some places soldiers are patrolling the streets to keep consumers and workers indoors, halting services and production and breaking supply chains.  \n \"The global health crisis is rapidly morphing into a global recession, as there is a clear tension between preventing infections and ruining the economy,\" said Edoardo Campanella, an economist at UniCredit Bank in Milan. \"However, a wise policy coordination between health and fiscal authorities should allow a V-shaped recovery once containment measures are relaxed.\"  \n Data firm IHS Markit said on Tuesday its flash U.S. Composite Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, dropped to a reading of 40.5 this month. That was an all-time low and followed a reading of 49.6 in February.  \n Last month's decline in the index, which is seen as a good measure of economic health, was the largest in the series' history. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in business activity. The survey underscored the rapidly deteriorating economy, highlighted last week by a government report showing the biggest rise since 2012 in the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits during the week ended March 14.  \n Economists are predicting claims will accelerate to a record 1.5 million or more when data for last week is published on Thursday.  \n The message was equally grim from the 19 countries that use the euro. IHS Markit's flash composite PMI for the euro zone plummeted to a record low of 31.4 in March.  \n That was by far the biggest one-month fall since the survey began in mid-1998 and below all forecasts in a Reuters poll which gave a median prediction of 38.8.  \n In France, services activity fell to a record low and manufacturing saw its steepest drop since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.  \n A PMI for the services sector in Germany, Europe's largest economy, showed a record contraction in activity, while sister surveys showed Britain's economy shrinking at a record pace.  \n IHS Markit said the March figures suggested the euro zone economy was shrinking at a quarterly rate of around 2%, and the escalation of measures to contain the virus could steepen the downturn.  \n With most asset markets tanking, global central banks have been rolling out extraordinary measures on an almost daily basis to stop the rot. But some analysts say infinite monetary policy easing may not be enough and fiscal steps are crucial.  \n There was some optimism on that front, with senior Democrats and Republicans saying on Tuesday they were close to reaching a deal on a $2 trillion stimulus package to aid the U.S. economy.  \n Hopes for a large fiscal stimulus sparked a sharp rebound in global stock markets, with the Dow Jones <.DJI> raking up its biggest one-day percentage gain since 1933. (Graphic: Coronavirus pandemic hits global business - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3868/3829/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES  \n After an initial outbreak in China brought the world's second-largest economy to a virtual halt last month, an ever-growing number of countries and territories have reported a spike in infections and deaths, leading to \"social distancing\" policies aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19.  \n Goldman Sachs is predicting that the global economy will shrink 1.0% this year, with gross domestic product in China estimated to contract at a 42% annualised rate in the first quarter and GDP in the United States dropping at a record 24% rate in the April-June period.  \n \"The coronacrisis has pushed the world economy into a deep recession,\" said Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius. \"The response to that crisis represents a physical constraint on economic activity that is unprecedented in postwar history.\"  \n The bleak U.S. economic picture ahead of the November presidential election has prompted President Donald Trump to push for businesses to reopen by Easter. Given rising infections and death toll, health experts, economists and politicians have cautioned against such a move, which they say could backfire, with Americans remaining fearful of going out.  \n Trump and Vice President Mike Pence held a conference call with major Wall Street investors on Tuesday.  \n \"Sending the public back to work at this time would be premature,\" said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM in New York. \"The U.S. is better off taking a one-time hit to economic growth, as efforts to terminate the virus continue, rather than run the risk of multiple economic shutdowns.\" (Graphic: U.S. stocks have fallen hard - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3867/3828/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n Mirroring the emptying of supermarket shelves around the world, indebted corporates have rushed into money markets to hoard dollars, with a global shortage of dollar funding threatening to cripple firms from airlines to retailers.  \n PMI surveys from Japan showed the services sector shrinking at its fastest pace on record this month and factory activity contracting at its quickest in a decade.  \n This was consistent with a 4% contraction in 2020, Capital Economics senior economist Marcel Theliant said. The postponement of the Tokyo Olympics is expected to deal a heavy blow to the world's third-largest economy.  \n The U.S. Federal Reserve on Monday promised bottomless dollar funding and an array of programs to help keep companies afloat. For the first time, the Fed will back purchases of corporate bonds, backstop direct loans to companies and \"soon\" will roll out a programme to get credit to small and medium-sized businesses. It will also expand its asset purchases by \"as much as needed.\"  \n The Fed last week slashed borrowing costs to zero and took other emergency steps to keep the commercial paper, U.S. Treasury debt and foreign dollar funding markets functional.  \n G7 finance ministers and central bank governors on Tuesday pledged to expand fiscal and monetary actions for as long as necessary to restore growth and confidence.  \n With the International Monetary Fund predicting a global recession, the world's 20 largest economies agreed on Monday to develop an \"action plan,\" but without specifics.

        "news_content_translate_en": "HONG KONG — A \"strange pneumonia\" was circulating in northern Italy as long ago as November, weeks before doctors were made aware of the novel coronavirus outbreak in China, one of the European country's leading medical experts said this week. \n \"They [general practitioners] remember having seen very strange pneumonia, very severe, particularly in old people in December and even November,\" Dr Giuseppe Remuzzi, the director of the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan, said in an interview with the National Public Radio of the United States. \n \"This means that the virus was circulating, at least in [the northern region of] Lombardy and before we were aware of this outbreak occurring in China.\" \n Dr Remuzzi's comments came as scientists continue to search for the origin of the coronavirus. Chinese respiratory disease expert Zhong Nanshan said earlier that although China was the first to report the pathogen, it was not yet certain where it actually came from. \n Dr Remuzzi said it was only recently that he had heard from Italian doctors about the disease, which meant it had existed and been spreading without people's knowledge. \n Despite reporting its first locally transmitted coronavirus infections in Lombardy only on February 21 — it had had only imported cases before then — Italy has since had more than 63,000 confirmed cases and 6,000 deaths from Covid-19, the disease caused by the pathogen, as of Monday (March 23). By comparison, China has over 81,000 cases and 3,277 fatalities. \n Italy suspended all flights to China on Jan 31, the first nation to do so. \n In the central China city of Wuhan, where the epidemic was first identified, doctors began noticing a \"pneumonia with an unknown cause\" in December. The first known infection in the city can be traced back to December 1. \n A report by the South China Morning Post said that the first Chinese case might have been as early as mid-November, but that has not been confirmed by Beijing. \n The current thinking among the scientific community is that the first infection in Lombardy was the result of an Italian coming into contact with a Chinese in late January. However, if it can be shown that the novel coronavirus — officially known as SARS-CoV-2 — was in circulation in Italy in November, then that theory would be turned on its head. \n The debate over the possible origin of the pathogen has also been at the heart of a war of words between Beijing and Washington, with US President Donald Trump repeatedly referring to it as the \"Chinese virus\" and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling it the \"Wuhan virus\", infuriating Beijing in the process. \n Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian took to Twitter to contest the claims. \n \"By calling it 'China virus' and thus suggesting its origin without any supporting facts or evidence, some media clearly want China to take the blame, and their ulterior motives are laid bare,\" he said. \n He then went on to suggest that the coronavirus outbreak might have started in the United States and been carried to Wuhan by the US Army.

        "news_content_translate_en": "NEW YORK - An old malaria treatment that has been tried with some success against the new coronavirus and was touted by U.S. President Donald Trump at a news briefing earlier on Thursday is in short supply as demand surges amid the fast-spreading outbreak.  \n The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP), which maintains a list of drugs in shortage independent of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's list, added the generic malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to its list on Thursday. Four out of eight manufacturers of the drug are currently in shortage, it said.  \n The new coronavirus, which causes the highly contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness, emerged in December in Wuhan, China and has spread throughout the world.  \n There are currently no vaccines or treatments approved for the disease, but researchers are studying existing treatments and working on experimental ones. At the moment, most patients can only receive supportive care.  \n Erin Fox, senior director of drug information at University of Utah Health, who maintains ASHP's shortages list, said pharmacists are unable to get the drug or fill prescriptions in full.  \n Fox said that University of Utah's 12 retail pharmacies are not filling prescriptions for prophylactic use, and are preserving their stocks for inpatient needs.  \n The FDA could not be reached for comment, but hydroxychloroquine is not currently on its drugs in shortage list.  \n Trump called on U.S. health regulators to expedite potential therapies aimed at treating COVID-19, including hydroxychloroquine.  \n \"We're going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately,\" Trump said of the malaria drug at a White House briefing.  \n  \n RUN ON PHARMACIES  \n Fox and the FDA have been watching for drug shortages that could be due to supply chain issues with manufacturing in China and India. But surging demand in recent weeks is the issue with the malaria drug, which can also treat rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, according to online pharmacy, Honeybee Health.  \n Its co-Chief Executive Jessica Nouhavandi sent a letter to prescribers earlier this week, urging them to be aware of potential hoarding of the drug that could deprives those who really need it.  \n On Thursday, Nouhavandi said demand was its highest yet after Trump's comments.  \n Jeff Bartone, who owns Hock's Pharmacy in Vandalia, Ohio, said he purchased five bottles of hydroxychloroquine this morning, but within an hour the company that distributes it to his pharmacy had run out.  \n He said four backup prescription drug wholesalers were out of the drug as well.  \n Bartone said he does not typically stock large amounts of the drug because it is not widely prescribed.  \n Mylan NV <MYL.O> - one of the manufacturers ASHP said was in shortage - said it was ramping up production of the drug and expects to be in a position to begin supplying it more broadly in mid-April.  \n It said with the raw materials on hand it can make 50 million tablets to potentially treat more than 1.5 million patients.  \n Bayer AG <BAYGn.DE> said it would donate 3 million tablets of Resochin - a closely related drug known generically as chloroquine phosphate. Chloroquine is also in shortage, according to the ASHP.  \n Online pharmacy Valisure said it too was unable to order any chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine as of Thursday from its four distributors.  \n Valisure Chief Executive David Light said other potential treatments are also becoming difficult to obtain.  \n \"Kaletra and losartan are being rationed, meaning we are only allowed to order limited quantities at a time,\" he said.  \n Kaletra, a combination HIV treatment sold by AbbVie <ABBN.N>, and the generic blood pressure drug losartan have been considered as potential treatments for the virus, although Chinese investigators reported this week that Kaletra failed to improve outcomes for seriously ill COVID-19 patients.

        "news_content_translate_en": "If anyone’s been wondering where Mandopop heartthrob Wang Leehom has been lately, well, they finally have their answer. \n On Thursday (Mar 19), the 43-year-old singer updated his socials with a video where he revealed that he has been under self-quarantine for the past two months. Aside from the long duration of his quarantine, his actions were not exactly an unusual given the current circumstances with the COVID-19 pandemic, But a Taiwanese paper has managed to unearth more details from Leehom about his decision. \n According to the report, Leehom held two concerts in Wuhan, China (where the outbreak is believed to have originated from) on December 29 and 30 last year, and had spent time shaking hands and taking pictures with fans backstage after each show. \n He recalled coming down with a 39°C fever on January 10, but he didn’t think too much about it and soldiered on with another concert in Kunming the next day despite feeling unwell and still nursing a 38.5°C fever. As the coronavirus was still a relatively new thing back then, nobody suspected it might have anything to do with his condition. \n After sweating it out on stage for over three hours, the fever gradually subsided, and Leehom started to recover on the 12th. However, with more and more COVID-19 cases popping up around the world, he chose to do the responsible thing and quarantine himself at home in Taiwan despite no longer displaying any symptoms himself. \n His decision led him to quit his role as a judge on the latest season of Chinese singing reality competition The Treasured Voice, 'cos hey, better safe than sorry, right? \n Leehom then fondly recalled the iconic 2003 song he and a few others wrote to encourage those battling SARS, called ‘Hand in Hand’. “To this day, that is still the most meaningful song in my entire career,” he mused. “It made me realise that music can truly be food for the soul.” \n While he may not have written any new tunes for COVID-19, Leehom has still done his part by reminding his followers to continue washing their hands and practise social distancing while going through this tough time together. \n “After this is all over, we will definitely meet again,” he promised. \n Photos: Wang Leehom/Instagram, Wang Leehom/Weibo \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "On Monday (March 16), leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) announced a slew of measures to address the Covid-19 pandemic. The G7’s emphasis was distinctively on coordination and cooperation, with the measures covering information sharing, global economic relief, and public health. \n This can be seen as a lift for the multilateral system, amid the rise of divisive unilateralism among those who do not trust the global governance architecture. But the success of the G7’s actions will depend on how much the world trusts its capacity to handle the crisis. \n Indeed, if there is one word that encapsulates the governance challenge as Covid-19 wreaks havoc globally, it would be the word “trust”. \n Covid-19 has disrupted every aspect of life in affected countries, raised fears, and sparked uncertainties. Yet how people respond reduces to a crucial factor: Trust — or lack thereof — in their neighbours, their healthcare or welfare systems, and their authorities. \n When panic-buying or store runs broke out around the world, a familiar pattern played out over and over: People, facing uncertainty and fear, sought safety in stockpiling. \n Economists who study bank runs are familiar with this pattern: It illustrates an underlying logic of self-preservation amid uncertainty — and a lack of trust in the system to prevail. \n Yet individually-rational actions can lead to systemically-irrational outcomes, or in laymen’s terms: Panic. \n Making sure that a system is fit to meet people’s needs in a crisis — and then persuading them of such — must therefore be one of the major aspects of tackling the Covid-19 outbreak. \n DOMESTIC TRUST \n Leaders need stocks of legitimacy to be trusted in a crisis when so many unknowns abound, and they build these stocks outside of the crisis period. \n Approval of United States President Donald Trump’s handling of the crisis follows partisan political lines. \n According to aggregate surveys by statistical website fivethirtyeight.com, between 10 and 16 per cent of Democrats trusted his handling of the crisis while 75 to 87 per cent of Republicans approved of it. \n Because Mr Trump domestically has only played to his base, non-Republicans simply did not trust him and a litany of his missteps were carefully documented, which will make it harder for him to carry out interventions that are needed. \n A leader who senses he lacks trust may also be overly concerned with optics rather than overcoming the situation. \n Experts also need stocks of legitimacy in order to be heeded. Unfortunately, this is not as obvious as it should be. \n Britain’s Brexit process had poisoned the well (the British public infamously had had enough of experts, according to British cabinet minister Michael Gove) and far too much of the population were eager to dismiss expert advice, especially when that advice would be disruptive to everyday life while the virus still appeared distant.  \n Put together, there has been a trust deficit that has hampered the effective addressing of the crisis. \n The turmoil on global stock markets suggests most firms and investors have no trust in the management of the outbreak in major industrialised economies and are pricing in for a hard recession. \n INTERNATIONAL TRUST \n International cooperation also requires trust — between countries and with international organisations. When the crisis in Wuhan unfolded in January, the US offered to send expert assistance but was rebuffed. One wonders if the reverse will hold true should the crisis escalate in the US and China offers its help. \n Countries have always devised foreign policies that support their domestic interests and public opinion but doing so is a delicate matter when it comes to close neighbours whose reactions also have domestic impact. \n When one country trusts that the other is handling a problem effectively, things are fine. \n But when that trust does not hold because of insufficient information, it may be forced to take preventive measures, even at economic cost to itself, if only to assuage domestic pressure. \n In the early days of the outbreak in Wuhan, several countries risked Chinese ire as they announced travel bans from China. Yet today, it is China that is now following this logic to place travel restrictions on other countries. \n Attempts to cover up cases, the slow rollout of testing (and thus lack of information), or ineffectual responses make it difficult for neighbours to trust that others have a handle on the situation. Lower trust — and therefore raised defences — will be inevitable until they come to grips with the situation. \n MULTILATERAL TRUST \n Multilateral cooperation had been brought to its lowest ebb just prior to the outbreak of the crisis. \n International organisations such as the World Trade Organisation are teetering on the verge of collapse, with its dispute settlement mechanism broken. \n The US-China trade war, which had only just begun to show signs of abating, had led many countries to hedge against both superpowers. \n Britain chose to go with Huawei in its 5G infrastructure against the US’ wishes, while erstwhile Chinese partners were reviewing infrastructure projects on the backs of debt and sustainability fears. A lack of trust in the multilateral system preceded the Covid-19 outbreak. \n On Covid-19, the World Health Organization was initially criticised in Asia for not declaring an emergency earlier in January, sparking a petition with half a million signatures. It did eventually declare an emergency on Jan 31, followed by a pandemic on March 11. \n However, the emergency declaration on Jan 31 seemed to be ignored by those outside Asia, and many countries are now paying the price for this. Yet one must ask why the WHO’s warning went unheeded: Did it have enough legitimacy and trust to be taken seriously immediately? \n REBUILDING FRACTURED TRUST \n Whatever the case, the pandemic is now upon all of us. National interests around the globe have converged over Covid-19 and will require multilateral cooperation to effectively address it, so the G7’s coming together is welcome, though only a first step. \n Countries large and small, rich and poor, all have the same interest: To quash this disease as quickly as possible. It is also fundamentally a public health issue that can, like pandemics before, be defeated without politicisation. \n We are now seeing demonstrable success in Singapore, China, and South Korea that have effectively nullified the domestic threat of the virus — they now appear most impacted by importing it from countries where the virus is still uncontrolled. They have managed systems that are effective and trusted to contain their outbreaks. \n While many countries still need to put domestic control measures in place urgently, this is also a rare opportunity to strengthen a troubled multilateral system and should not be wasted. \n  ABOUT THE AUTHOR: \n Dr Joel Ng is a research fellow with the Centre for Multilateralism Studies, S.

        "news_content_translate_cn": "周一（3月16日），七国集团（G7）领导人宣布了一系列应对Covid-19大流行病的措施，七国集团特别强调协调与合作，措施包括信息共享、全球经济救济和公共卫生。\n在那些不信任全球治理架构的国家中，单边主义的分裂正在抬头，这可以被视为多边体系的一个提振，但七国集团行动的成功将取决于世界对其处理危机的能力的信任程度。\n事实上，如果有一个词概括了Covid-19在全球造成巨大破坏时所面临的治理挑战，那就是“信任”这个词。\nCovid-19已经扰乱了受影响国家生活的方方面面，引起了人们的担忧，并引发了不确定性。然而，人们的反应减少了一个关键因素：信任——或者缺乏——他们的邻居，他们的医疗或福利系统，以及他们的权威。\n当恐慌性购买或商店挤兑在世界各地爆发时，一种熟悉的模式反复上演：人们面对不确定性和恐惧，寻求安全的库存。\n研究银行挤兑的经济学家们对这种模式很熟悉：它说明了在不确定的情况下自我保护的基本逻辑——以及对银行体系缺乏信任的情况。\n然而，个人的理性行为可能导致系统性的非理性结果，或者通俗地说：恐慌。\n因此，确保一个系统能够在危机中满足人们的需求，然后说服他们这样做，必须是应对Covid-19疫情的主要方面之一。\n国内信托\n当如此多的未知因素充斥时，领导人需要在危机中信任合法性股票，他们在危机期之外建立这些股票。\n美国总统特朗普（Donald Trump）对危机处理的批准遵循党派政治路线。\n根据统计网站Fivethirty8的综合调.com网站上，10%到16%的民主党人相信他对危机的处理方式，而75%到87%的共和党人则表示赞同。\n因为特朗普在国内只发挥了自己的基础，非共和党人根本不信任他，而且他一系列的失误都被仔细记录在案，这将使他更难进行必要的干预。\n一个感觉自己缺乏信任的领导者也可能过分关注光学，而不是克服这种情况。\n专家们也需要有合法性的股票才能被关注，不幸的是，这并不像应该的那么明显。\n英国的脱欧进程毒害了这口井（根据英国内阁大臣迈克尔戈夫（Michael Gove）的说法，臭名昭著的英国公众已经有足够的专家了），而且太多的民众急于拒绝专家的建议，特别是当这种建议会对日常生活造成破坏，而病毒似乎仍然遥不可及的时候\n总而言之，目前存在的信任赤字阻碍了危机的有效解决。\n全球股市的动荡表明，大多数公司和投资者对主要工业化经济体爆发疫情的管理缺乏信心，并正在为一场严重衰退做好准备。\n国际信托\n国际合作还需要国家之间和国际组织之间的信任。今年1月武汉危机爆发时，美国曾表示愿意派遣专家协助，但遭到拒绝。人们不禁要问，如果美国危机升级，而中国提供帮助，这种情况是否会逆转。\n各国总是制定支持本国利益和公众舆论的外交政策，但对于反应也有国内影响的近邻来说，这样做是一个微妙的问题。\n当一个国家相信另一个国家正在有效地处理一个问题时，情况就好.\n但当这种信任由于信息不足而无法维系时，它可能被迫采取预防措施，即使是以自身的经济成本为代价，如果只是为了缓解国内压力的话。\n在武汉疫情爆发的早期，一些国家在宣布禁止从中国旅行时冒着中国愤怒的风险。然而今天，正是中国遵循这一逻辑，对其他国家实施旅行限制。\n试图掩盖案件、测试的缓慢展开（因此缺乏信息）或无效的回应，使得邻居们很难相信其他人有能力处理这种情况。在他们处理好这种局面之前，信任度降低——因此防御能力提高——将是不可避免的。\n多边信托\n就在危机爆发之前，多边合作已陷入低谷。\n世界贸易组织（wto）等国际组织正摇摇欲坠，濒临崩溃，其争端解决机制已被打破。\n美中贸易战刚刚开始显现缓和迹象，导致许多国家对这两个超级大国采取对冲措施。\n英国违背美国的意愿，选择与华为合作开发5G基础设施，而过去的中国合作伙伴则在债务和可持续性担忧的支持下审查基础设施项目。在Covid-19爆发之前，人们对多边体系缺乏信任。\n在Covid-19上，世界卫生组织（who）一月份早些时候在亚洲因没有宣布紧急状态而受到批评，引发了50万人签名的请愿书。它最终在1月31日宣布进入紧急状态，随后在3月11日爆发了一场大流行病。\n然而，1月31日的紧急声明似乎被亚洲以外的国家忽视了，许多国家正在为此付出代. 然而，人们必须问，为什么世界卫生组织的警告没有得到重视：它是否具有足够的合法性和信任，可以立即受到重视？\n重建断开的信任\n不管是什么情况，现在我们大家都面临着流行病。全球各国的利益已经在Covid-19上趋同，需要多边合作才能有效解决这一问题，因此七国集团走到一起是值得欢迎的，尽管这只是第一步。\n大小国家，贫富国家，都有同样的利益：尽快消灭这种疾病。从根本上讲，这也是一个公共卫生问题，可以像以前的流行病一样，在没有政治化的情况下被击败。\n我们现在在新加坡、中国和韩国看到了明显的成功，这些国家已经有效地消除了国内的病毒威胁——它们现在似乎受到了从那些病毒仍然无法控制的国家进口病毒的最大影响。他们管理的系统是有效和可信的，可以控制疫情。\n虽然许多国家仍需紧急落实国内控制措施，但这也是加强陷入困境的多边体系的难得机会，不应浪费。\n关于作者：\n吴俊杰博士是南洋理工大学拉贾拉特南国际研究学院多边主义研究中心研究员。这首先出现在RSIS评论中",

        "news_content_translate_en": "It’s now impossible to ignore the ever-growing threat of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially after Singapore has shut its doors to countries that are hardest-hit by the virus and sent out a call for citizens to minimise travelling where possible. \n Over in Europe, which is arguably the current epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak, France has become the third EU country after Italy and Spain to be on lockdown in a bid to contain the rapid spread of the virus. \n Former Mediacorp host Sharon Au, who moved to Paris in 2018, has become one of the many Singaporeans who have been affected by the lockdown, although the 44-year-old sounded as cheery and collected as ever when she spoke to 8days.sg over the phone from her home in the French city.  \n “It’s been like… Over an hour since the lockdown came into effect?” she quips as we ask her how she’s dealing with being cooped up at home. “They only announced it last night, so it hasn’t quite sunk in yet.” \n This isn’t her first brush with having to deal with a crisis, as she recounted how she was in Japan in 2011, when the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster occurred. Perhaps that’s why she has taken everything in her stride, or perhaps, she chuckles, she’s adapted to the French c'est la vie (or 'taking life as it comes') mindset.  \n Having said that, Sharon is still very much Singaporean and admitted that she couldn't help but feel a tiny bit compelled to return to Singapore, especially after her friends and family texted her to come home following French president Emmanuel Macron's lockdown announcement. \n She mused: “Life still goes on. Even if I wanted to come home, I can’t because of the lockdown. For now, it’s in effect for 15 days, but realistically speaking, it could last for way longer than that if you look at how quickly the number of patients is increasing. Honestly, I might be safer staying in my apartment than being at the airports right now. I’m aware that a lot of cases now are imported as people making their way home or away from the hotspots, so I think less traveling is better for now.” \n 8 DAYS: What's going through your mind now?SHARON AU: There’s actually a sense of normalcy because everyone outside is so calm. (Laughs) It’s definitely not as exciting as my friends thought [it would be]. I went out for a walk before the lockdown came into effect. I went to the bakery and had a stroll along the Seine river since I knew it might be a while before I could do that again. \n Are you not allowed to go out at all?If you have to go out for emergency purposes such as seeing a doctor, going to the pharmacy, or you need to buy food, you need to download an approval form from the government website. After filling in the details, you need to print it out and carry it with you when you go out. It’s a bit extreme and if you’re found without the form, or without your identity card, they can fine you. Oh, one of the possible reasons for you to leave the house is to walk your dog. (chuckles) \n That doesn’t seem too bad.It’s alright for us because we have access to news all the time, but I expect it to be very hard for tourists. The Singapore embassy has been posting a lot of information and asking us to spread it on social media. Tourists might not be privy to announcements, so they might not know that they need to fulfill those requirements in order to step out of wherever they are staying at. That being said, the French are very flexible so even if they do catch the tourists, they might just fine them the minimum of 38 Euros and explain the current situation to them. \n Are there still a lot of tourists around?Even before the lockdown, I went to the Champs-Élysées and it was completely empty! It was like a ghost town. I anticipated that stricter measures would come soon, because the situation felt very grave and people are taking travel advisories very seriously. \n You went to the bakery, but not the supermarket, before the lockdown was announced. Why?Even before the announcement, I’ve been going to the supermarket regularly to buy food and ingredients to cook at home. We dine out less often these days because of the current health issues. But that day, I wanted to get my favourite pain au chocolat to munch on as I strolled down the river, and I also got two traditional desserts to eat after dinner. \n Have there been instances of grocery hoarding?The panic shopping hasn’t really manifested. Of course, there were queues in front of the supermarket and bakery, but it’s not extraordinarily terrible. People don’t hoard products. I see people coming out with bags full of stuff, but they just buy what they need for a week. \n That's great. I think it also helps that people feel assured. For example, two days ago, I went to buy eggs and the entire shelf was empty. But when I went the next day, it was refilled and there’s no shortage whatsoever. \n So you’re set for the next 15 days, right?(laughs) I’m going to overeat for sure. I just keep opening stuff to eat when I'm at home and it's worse because it's all snacking! I can imagine myself reaching out for Nutella while I’m doing my work, so that’s not very healthy either. My pilates classes are obviously cancelled so I’m going to turn the carpet into my yoga mat for now. \n Is it still possible to get food delivered to you?Definitely. My friend Pearl owns the one and only Singapore food restaurant in Paris. It’s called The Hood and she’s converting her kitchen to one that is fully delivery-based right now. Restaurateurs need to survive because people can’t go to them any more, so they have to do deliveries. There’s an Italian restaurant just below where I live that I go to very often. The owner saw me and gave me his number, telling me to call him anytime I or anyone in the building needs food and he will get it delivered to us. I think it’s very important to help each other out wherever we can, especially in times like these. \n Have there been queues for masks?Even when I went down for a walk just now after the president’s very serious declaration, nobody wore masks. I was one of the three people who was wearing one. It’s quite strange and I’m not sure why. \n Is it because they’re sold out everywhere?(Pauses) Ah. I'm looking it up on the Internet right now. Masks are by prescription, so you have to go to a doctor or pharmacist to get a prescription to get masks. Even then, people are just not used to wearing masks. They might use their scarves to cover their faces so you can only see their eyes, and that’s about it. If you see people wearing masks, it’s probably me or other tourists. (laughs) \n How much does it cost to get masks right now?Hmm, let me check. Wow. The FFP2 mask, which is really high end, is €9.90 (S$15.50) each. Wow. (Pauses) There are the regular surgical masks too, which are €4.90 (S$7.70) for 50 masks. I’m checking the prices online now, but you can’t just order it on the Internet. Currently, they’re reserved only for hospitals and healthcare workers. \n Does that mean that people can’t get masks now?Even if they were available, the people here still wouldn't wear masks. That’s why I think the lockdown is really necessary in this instance. The French don’t really take advice or instructions very well. When we were told not to gather in big groups, you walk past the bars and restaurants and they’d be packed and you'd see people partying. (laughs)​​​​​​​ French people in general are very chill. During the lockdown announcement, the president sounded very exasperated that people didn’t heed the advice and instructions and he mentioned that it’s really frustrating for the government. They're very unlike Singaporeans. Once our government says something, we will do it. \n But they’ll stay indoors now that the lockdown is in place, right?Wow. Actually, I have no idea! It’s been less than two hours, and since I’m at home, I don’t really know what it’s like outside. I hope they do listen, though. The president kept saying that we’re at war and it’s really surreal to hear such announcements. I hope that the people who have been underestimating and mocking the virus will sit up and realise that it’s all our responsibility to be non-spreaders. \n Non-spreaders?Yes! There have been so many instances where people were complacent because they didn’t display any symptoms, so they think that they aren’t carriers, but ended up spreading it to others. It's terrible. \n Asians all over the world have told stories of being treated unfairly since the outbreak began. Have you personally encountered any incidents?I’ve heard a lot of unpleasant experiences from my friends. Fortunately, I haven’t personally encountered such treatment, even when I traveled to London for work and to babysit my godchildren. There were a lot of negative displays towards Chinese people there, but I was very lucky. That being said, I’m sure encounters like that exist. People don’t just lie about bad experiences like that. Even in Paris, some of my friends had pretty bad experiences. \n Such as?I won’t go into specifics, but I’m guessing that might be because of where they live and hang out. I live in the office area and it’s very cosmopolitan here. My residential area is mostly made up of elderly folk and they’re just very sweet. \n There have also been viral videos on social media of Italians singing from their balconies. Has anyone in the neighbourhood done that yet?(Chuckles) I’ve watched those videos and I’m just so encouraged by them. It shows how passionate the Italians are. In Paris, it’ll probably differ according to which district you’re living in. I used to stay in the 4th district. I can imagine that people will party and sing in the balcony because it’s a very flamboyant and joyous district. Here, however, the age range is a lot more skewed towards the older folk and I’m not sure if they will appreciate noise. (Laughs) I’m not sure how they’ll react if I start singing from my balcony. \n You could always go with a classic that they would love.People might join in if I pick the French national anthem. Or you might just end up seeing a video of me singing to the Eiffel Tower with everybody trying their best to ignore me. (laughs) \n Are you really going to do that?I seriously might, because it’s going to get so boring after Day Three of the lockdown. I’ll send you the video if I really do it. \n Once the lockdown is over, will you have enough masks to wear?I brought a packet of 10 when I came back from Singapore, and my friends gave me some when they came to visit. I’d say I have like 20 right now. I guess that’s okay since we won’t be going out anytime soon. \n Did you wear one all the time before the lockdown?(Hesitates) I came back in the middle of February and because I was back home, we were trained and conditioned to wear masks. But when I landed in France, I immediately took off my masks because people would look strangely at me if I was wearing one. Then, it was still viewed as an Asian virus and I didn’t have the courage to wear it because I felt uneasy about the way people might look at me. I was also worried that they might even beat me up. On hindsight, I think I was pretty cowardly.As I carried on with my day-to-day life, I didn’t wear a mask on the subway or on the bus. I had an internal struggle between feeling uncomfortable having people stare at me if I wore a mask versus just walking to where I wanted to go, and I ended up just walking, because I wouldn’t be in an enclosed space with so many people if I were outside. \n That must not have been easy.Yes, but now it seems like the tables have turned! When I was on my walk just now, people were looking at me as though they wanted to take my mask away from me. Personally, I feel that we should’ve gotten prepared long ago. The outbreak started in China late last year, and while China was having to deal with the widespread effect of the virus, people on this side of the world were were just looking at them thinking that it would never happen to them. Some of the Western press were mocking how Wuhan went into lockdown 'cos they felt that it was too drastic, but now they have to resort to the same measures. \n We're glad to hear that you're doing okay.(Pauses) I can only say that everything feels normal because I'm healthy. I can’t imagine having to face uncertainties of whether I’m able to have access to healthcare when I need it. It’s also a very timely reminder that we should respect regulations and rules and not take things lightly. I hope the people here now have that drilled into their minds.C'est la vie — that’s their culture. The French are very chill and laugh things off very easily. I think it’s cool, but not when there’s a health war going on. The gravity of this issue needs to be addressed as how the Asian countries have done so. I’m really so proud of Singapore and Taiwan for coping with it as well as they have. Even in South Korea, it was like a bomb went off there two weeks back, but when you look at it now, the mortality rate is so low and their numbers are under control. \n In Europe, it’s almost as though healthcare can’t cope because their mortality rate is through the roof. It’s time for everyone to face reality.  \n Photos: Sharon Au's Instagram \n ",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "现在不可能忽视COVID-19流行病日益严重的威胁，特别是在新加坡关闭了对受病毒影响最严重的国家的大门，并呼吁公民尽可能减少旅行之后。\n在欧洲，法国已经成为继意大利和西班牙之后第三个被封锁的欧盟国家，以控制病毒的快速传播。\n2018年移居巴黎的前媒体公司（Mediacorp）主持人欧琰（Sharon Au）成为众多受到封锁影响的新加坡人之一，尽管44岁的她在法国城市的家中通过电话与8days.sg交谈时，语气和以往一样欢快和镇定。\n“自从封锁生效以来……已经一个多小时了？“当我们问她如何处理被关在家里时，她开玩笑说。“他们昨晚才宣布的，所以还没有完全沉沦。”\n这并不是她第一次不得不面对危机，因为她讲述了2011年在日本发生的东北地震和海啸，以及随后发生的福岛第一核电站核灾难。也许这就是为什么她对一切都泰然自若，或者，她笑着说，她已经适应了法国式的生活方式。\n尽管如此，沙龙还是非常新加坡人，她承认自己忍不住有一点被迫返回新加坡，特别是在法国总统马克龙宣布禁闭后，她的朋友和家人给她发短信让她回家之后。\n她沉思道：“生活还在继续。即使我想回家，也不能因为封锁。目前，它有效期为15天，但事实上，如果你观察病人数量增长的速度，它可能会持续更长的时间. 老实说，我呆在公寓里可能比现在在机场更安全。我知道，现在很多病例是随着人们回家或离开热点地区而进口的，所以我认为现在减少旅行更好。”\n8天：你现在在想什么？奥：其实有一种正常的感觉，因为外面的每个人都很平静。（笑）这绝对不像我的朋友们想的那样令人兴奋。在封锁生效之前我出去散步了。我去了面包店，沿着塞纳河散步，因为我知道我可能需要一段时间才能再这样做。\n你根本不允许出去吗？如果你必须为了紧急目的外出，如看医生，去药房，或者你需要购买食物，你需要从政府网站下载一份批准表。填写完详细资料后，需要打印出来，出门时随身携带。这有点极端，如果你被发现没有表格，或没有身份证，他们可以罚款你。哦，你离开家的可能原因之一是遛狗。（笑）\n这看起来还不算太糟。对我们来说没关系，因为我们随时都可以接触到新闻，但我想这对游客来说很难。新加坡大使馆已经发布了很多信息，并要求我们在社交媒体上传播。旅游者可能不知道这些通知，所以他们可能不知道他们需要满足这些要求，以便走出他们所住的地方。也就是说，法国人非常灵活，所以即使他们抓住了游客，他们也可能会罚款最低38欧元，并向他们解释目前的情况。\n周围还有很多游客吗？甚至在禁闭之前，我就去了香榭丽舍大街，那里完全是空的！就像鬼城一样. 我预计很快就会采取更严格的措施，因为形势非常严峻，人们对旅游咨询非常重视。\n在宣布封锁前，你去了面包店，但没有去超市。为什么？甚至在宣布之前，我就经常去超市买食物和食材在家做饭。由于目前的健康问题，我们现在很少出去吃饭。但那天，我想买我最喜欢的止痛巧克力，一边沿河散步一边大嚼，晚饭后还吃了两道传统甜点。\n有没有囤积食品杂货的例子？恐慌性购物并没有真正表现出来。当然，超市和面包店门前也有排队的人，但并不特别可怕。人们不囤积产品。我看到人们提着装满东西的袋子出来，但他们只是买了一个星期所需要的东西。\n太好了。我认为这也有助于人们感到放心。例如，两天前，我去买鸡蛋，整个架子都空了。但是当我第二天去的时候，它被重新装满了，而且一点也不缺。\n所以你准备好了接下来的15天，对吧？（笑）我肯定会暴饮暴食。我只是在家里不停地打开吃的东西，更糟的是因为都是零食！我可以想象自己在工作的时候伸手去拿Nutella，这样也不太健康。我的普拉提课显然取消了，所以我现在要把地毯改成瑜伽垫。\n还有可能把食物送到你这里吗？一定地。我的朋友珀尔在巴黎拥有一家也是唯一一家新加坡餐厅。这叫做引擎盖，她正在把她的厨房改造成一个完全以送货为基础的厨房。餐馆老板需要生存，因为人们不能再去他们那里了，所以他们必须送货。我住的地方下面有一家意大利餐馆，我经常去那里. 店主看到了我，给了我他的电话号码，告诉我，只要我或任何人需要食物就给他打电话，他会把食物送到我们这里的。我认为无论我们在什么地方互相帮助都是非常重要的，尤其是在这样的时候。\n有人排队买面具吗？即使在总统发表了非常严肃的声明之后，我刚刚去散步，也没有人戴口罩。我是三个人中的一个。很奇怪，我不知道为什么。\n是因为到处都卖光了吗？（停顿）啊。我正在网上查。口罩是按处方配药的，所以你得去看医生或药剂师才能拿到口罩的处方。即便如此，人们还是不习惯戴口罩。他们可能会用围巾遮住脸，这样你只能看到他们的眼睛，就这样了。如果你看到人们戴着面具，可能是我或其他游客。（笑）\n现在买面具要多少钱？嗯，让我查一下。真 的。真正高端的FFP2面膜，每只售价9.90欧元（15.50新元）。真 的。（停顿）还有普通的外科口罩，50个口罩4.90欧元（7.70新元）。我正在网上查价格，但你不能只在网上订购。目前，它们只为医院和医护人员保留。\n这是否意味着人们现在不能戴面具？即使有，这里的人还是不戴面具。这就是为什么我认为在这种情况下封锁是非常必要的。法国人并没有很好地接受建议或指示。当我们被告知不要成群结队的时候，你走过酒吧和餐馆，他们就会挤满了人，你会看到人们在聚会。（笑）一般法国人都很冷淡。在宣布封锁期间，总统听起来非常恼火，因为人们不听劝告和指示，他提到这对政府来说真的很令人沮丧。他们和新加坡人很不一样. 一旦我们的政府说了什么，我们就会做。\n但既然封锁已经到位，他们就呆在家里，对吧？真 的。实际上，我不知道！不到两个小时，既然我在家，我真的不知道外面是什么样子。不过，我希望他们听我的。总统一直说我们在打仗，听到这样的声明真是太离奇了。我希望那些低估和嘲笑病毒的人会坐起来，意识到我们的责任就是不传播病毒。\n非撒布者？对！很多情况下，人们因为没有表现出任何症状而沾沾自喜，因此他们认为自己不是携带者，但最终却将其传播给了其他人。太可怕了。\n自从疫情爆发以来，全世界的亚洲人都讲过受到不公平待遇的故事。你个人有没有遇到什么意外？我从朋友那里听到了很多不愉快的经历。幸运的是，我个人并没有遇到过这样的待遇，即使我去伦敦工作和照看我的教子。那里对中国人有很多负面的表现，但我很幸运。尽管如此，我相信这样的遭遇是存在的。人们不只是在这种糟糕的经历上撒谎。即使在巴黎，我的一些朋友也有过相当糟糕的经历。\n比如说？我不想详细说明，但我想这可能是因为他们住在哪里，在哪里闲逛。我住在办公区，这里很国际化。我住的地方大部分是老年人，他们非常可爱。\n社交媒体上也有意大利人在阳台上唱歌的病毒视频。附近有人做过吗？（笑）我看过那些视频，我很受鼓舞。它显示了意大利人的热情。在巴黎，你所居住的地区可能会有所不同。我以前住在第四区. 我可以想象人们会在阳台上聚会和唱歌，因为这是一个非常华丽和欢乐的地区。然而，这里的年龄范围更倾向于老年人，我不确定他们是否会喜欢噪音。（笑）如果我从阳台开始唱歌，我不知道他们会有什么反应。\n你可以选择他们喜欢的经典歌曲。如果我选法国国歌，人们可能会加入。或者你可能会看到一段我在埃菲尔铁塔上唱歌的视频，每个人都尽力不理我。（笑）\n你真的要这么做吗？我真的可能，因为在禁闭的第三天之后会变得很无聊。如果我真的这么做了，我会把视频发给你的。\n一旦封锁结束，你有足够的面具戴吗？我从新加坡回来时带了一包10元的，我的朋友来看我时也给了我一些。我想我现在大概有20个。我想没关系，因为我们近期不会出去了。\n在禁闭前你一直戴着吗？（犹豫了一下）我2月中旬回来，因为我回到家，我们接受了戴口罩的训练和训练。但当我在法国着陆时，我立刻摘下了我的面具，因为如果我戴着面具，人们会奇怪地看着我。后来，它仍然被视为一种亚洲病毒，我没有勇气穿上它，因为我对人们看我的方式感到不安。我还担心他们会打我。事后看来，我觉得自己很懦弱，在继续我的日常生活时，我在地铁和公交车上都没有戴口罩。我内心有一种挣扎，如果我戴着面具，别人盯着我看，我会觉得不舒服，而不是走到我想去的地方，最后我只是走，因为如果我在外面，我不会和这么多人在一个封闭的空间里。\n那一定不容易是的，但现在看来一切都变了！刚才我散步的时候，人们看着我，好像想把我的面具从我身上拿开似的。就我个人而言，我觉得我们早就该准备好了。去年年底，疫情在中国爆发，虽然中国必须应对病毒的广泛影响，但世界这一边的人们只是看着他们，认为这永远不会发生在他们身上。一些西方媒体嘲笑武汉是如何进入禁闭状态的，因为他们觉得这太过激了，但现在他们不得不采取同样的措施。\n我们很高兴听到你做得很好。（停顿）我只能说一切都感觉正常，因为我很健康。我无法想象当我需要医疗服务时，我是否能够获得医疗服务的不确定性。这也非常及时地提醒我们，要尊重规章制度，不能掉以轻心。我希望这里的人们现在有了他们的思想。这就是他们的文化。法国人很冷淡，很容易把事情搞笑。我认为这很酷，但当一场健康战争开始时就不行了。这个问题的严重性需要像亚洲国家那样加以解决。我真的为新加坡和台湾能像他们一样处理好这件事而感到骄傲。即使在韩国，这就像两周前的炸弹爆炸一样，但现在你看，死亡率如此之低，而且他们的数量也在控制之中。\n在欧洲，医疗保健几乎无法应付，因为他们的死亡率高得离谱。是时候让每个人都面对现实了。\n照片：Au Sharon的Instagram",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The coronavirus pandemic is \"accelerating\": the alert is from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and was given this Monday by its Director General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \"It took 67 days since the first reported case to reach the 100 thousand cases, 11 days for the second 100 thousand, and only four days for the third hundred thousand\", he summarized. \"We need unity between the G20 countries that have more than 80% of global GDP. If we do not give priority to the protection of health workers, many people will die because the healthcare worker who could save their lives is ill,\"said the person responsible.\nOn the day when the number of infected exceeded the 370 thousand, the deaths exceeded the 16 thousand and those recovered the 100 thousand. Italy, with more than 63 thousand cases, is rapidly approaching the number of cases in China (81 thousand), with deaths in Italy (more than six thousand) almost twice as many as in Chinese territory (more than three thousand). The Beijing authorities have advanced that the country is still without local cases of infection, while the Roma have closed off non-essential production throughout the country.\nWith more than 35 thousand cases of infection and more than two thousand dead, see here how Spain came in the same way as Italy. One more fact that can help explain: elderly people in Spanish homes live in the same space as corpses that are not removed from their rooms. The country has renewed its alarm status for another two weeks.\nStill in Spain, actress Luc ia Bose died at the age of 89 in a hospital in Segovia. Another fatal victim of the pandemic in that country was former Member Jose Folgado, who was Secretary of State for Energy in the Governments of Jose Maria Aznar and President of the Electrical Network.\nThe Portuguese ambassador to Spain has issued an alert, urging the Portuguese to avoid travelling and stay at homYeah.\nIn France, the National Health Agency announced that three doctors died after contracting coronavirus.\nThe European Parliament has also reported its first kill by mistake-19 and is offering psychological support to its officials.\nAuthorities in Panama have confirmed the death of a 13-year-old girl, one of the youngest victims of the pandemic. Overall figures indicate that covid-19 is most dangerous in patients already suffering from health problems and among the older population. However, the death of the teenager in that country is giving more force to the warnings that have been issued by experts: young adults and children are not immune to the risk of infection and suffer serious consequences.\nUS President Donald Trump urged his fellow citizens to stand united. \"I want the Americans to know that we will overcome this challenge. Normal life will return,\"he said. Although he continually referred to the coronavirus as a \"Chinese virus\", Trump stated that Asian Americans should not be held accountable. Trump assured him that he would not let \"healing be worse than the problem itself\". \"This is a medical problem. We will not let the coronavirus become a long-term financial problem,\"he added. US health authorities have registered over a hundred deaths in a single day, which raises the death toll to 545 across the country.\nFormer film producer Harvey Weinstein, arrested for rape and sexual abuse, is infected with coronavirus. Information has come from the state's correctional authorities in New York, where he is serving a 23-year prison sentence.\nIn the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Boris Johnson indicated that there are only five reasons to leave the house: to buy food, exercise once a day, go to the doctor or pharmacist, go to work (but only if it is not even possible to work from home) and help vulnerable peoplYeah. Leaving the house under any other circumstances is prohibited. \"We will get to the point where no health care system in the world can handle this virus,\" said the head of the British Government.\nLearn about the \"German exception\" link and what explains a lethality rate of only 0.3%. Angela Merkel received the first test result, which was negative. The German chancellor has been in quarantine since Sunday, after a doctor with whom she had been positive about the virus. In the meantime, Merkel is surrounded to throw away the coronabonds'taboo. A brief memory exercise: in 2012, at the height of the sovereign debt crisis, the Chancellor assured that there would be European bonds over her dead body that would allow the debt of the euro area to be mutualised. Now, you're probably gonna have to find a coronabond, whatever it is.\nThe Finance Ministers of the 27 Member States of the European Union (EU) endorsed the suspension of budgetary discipline, validating the European Commission proposal freeing governments from the recommended deficit targets. The goal is to increase their margin for manoeuvre so that they can inject more money into fighting the pandemic. Brussels has made it clear that it wants green roads at the borders for the transport of goods. And the EU was also prepared to give financial aid to Venezuela and Iran,'which are in greatest difficulty because of sanctions'.\nDespite the Commission's change of strategy, European fellowships opened in red this Monday. Technologies also tremble: although they are one of the most dynamic sectors in the world and those most capable of teleworking, these characteristics do not render them immune to the impacts of the pandemic. In the US, the Federal Reserve will do unlimited shoppinYeah.\nAccording to a review carried out by Agency France-Presse, more than one billion people in more than fifty countries or territories are confined to their homes by the order of their authorities. But the WHO warns that containment may not be enough to defeat the virus.\nOn the African continent, the most affected country, South Africa, has announced that its citizens will be in isolation from Thursday. In Ethiopia, the strategy is to close the land borders.\nIn India too, there are stricter containment measures and internal flights are suspended.\nIn Brazil, Rio de Janeiro is quarantined and only supermarkets and pharmacies are left open.\nThe day was also marked by the unknown regarding the Tokyo Olympic Games. Canada has started by ensuring that if the Olympics take place this year, the country will not send its athletes to Tokyo. The Japanese Prime Minister stated that \"annulment is not a possibility\", but acknowledged that postponing the competition \"may be inevitable\". In an interview with USA Today newspaper, Dick Pound, the most senior member of the International Olympic Committee, said that the decision to postpone the Games is \"made\". It is already \"certain\" that the proof, which was supposed to start the 24th of July, \"will not start on that date,\" he assured.\nIn the environment, good news: pollution levels are falling significantly worldwide with the pandemic. Another good news in the line of fighting the virus through 3D printing: visors, masks and fans are being manufactured a little throughout the world, including in Portugal.\nOne bad news: tourism loses one million jobs every day at global level.\nAnd in closing, the WHO warns of fraud in full pandemic",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Sir, sir.\nPresident of the Portuguese Republic\nDr. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa,\nFirst of all, I would like to congratulate you on having declared the state of emergency in Portugal and on your subsequent speech to the country. Indeed, the times we live in are terrible and merciless. And they have no pity or hesitation.\nThat's why your word and action are important. Personally, I was also very pleased that there was almost unanimity in answering this question by the Assembly of the Republic and the Government. But now, in the very short time available to us (and which is being shortened by the hour) more and more needs to be done, of a health and political nature!\nI therefore appeal to you, as a Portuguese and a European citizen, to exert your enormous symbolic and diplomatic influence on countries or regions that have shared historical, commercial and mutual help relations with Portugal for more than 500 years now, so that you can help us now, at this time of enormous need. Of course, I am talking about Japan and the People's Republic of China, with special emphasis on the Macao Special Administrative RegioYeah. Indeed, fruit of having had to deal with the SARS epidemic at the beginning of this millennium and now with that of Covid-19, China and its Special Administrative Regions are prepared like no other country, with possible exceptions from Japan and South Korea, to help us in this fight which, Having now come to us in a most astonishing way, he will not soon let us sleep soundly!\nThis aid should not only be of a material nature, with its protective, diagnostic and treatment equipment (e.g. masks, medicines and fans) that we already have and will be increasingly lacking in our NHS, as the situation gets worse, but also and perhaps above all, should be through sharing epidemiological knowledge and public health! In fact, it is high time that we had foreign experts to help us, especially in Lisbon and with the government, and, if this is not possible, at least with the help of videoconferences, to advise advisers, advisors and, ideally and directly, those responsible for conducting this fight, Mr President, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Health and the Director of the DGS. Not to mention the specialized council of the members of the National Board of Health or at least evident National Public Health Council!\nMr President, I have had my students without classes for more than a week, but our teachers are doing their best, as are many other teachers across the country, to try to mitigate this situation by giving distance lessons. But much worse, I also have countless colleagues and friends who have long since clashed in emergency rooms, in the wards and in intensive care of St John's University Hospital Centre, committed to tracking down and treating patients with Covid-19 and adding to their usual patientYeah. And at this moment, beating each other almost as much as much before had been done by their grandparents or great-grandparents in the trenches of the First War in La Lys. And if we consider what remains to be done to reach the peak of the epidemic, we are still at the beginning of its progression in Portugal.\nIn other words, Mr President, in a time of absolute truth and emergency, it is time for us not to be afraid to confess our own limitations as a country, as politicians or even as experts, and, recognising this, it is time to ask for help from those who are best able to help us!\nAnd above all, not forgetting that delaying or postponing it, just for a day or a few hours, from a correct decision to isolate the population more narrowly or to screen more intensively cases in the population could prevent the death of a very considerable number of Portuguese people.

This is really a terrible blow to the economies of the whole world.” \n While the 1997 crisis affected millions of people as economies contracted and currencies plunged, Malaysia was better off, rebounding economically in just one year. \n Much of it was credited to Dr Mahathir who was the architect of Malaysia’s capital controls in 1998. \n “This time, pegging the exchange rate won’t help. \n “Investor confidence is very low not only for Malaysia, it’s for the whole world,” he was quoted as saying. \n “Because if you invest and you cannot sell, you don’t invest.” \n After a recent political crisis, Mr Muhyiddin Yassin is now the prime minister. \n However, Dr Mahathir said he has doubt over the new government’s ability to steer the country to recovery. \n “This is the wrong time to take over the government. \n “The country has never been in such a state before.” \n Other world leaders have also issued similar warnings. \n European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde had said the economic fallout could be as bad as the 2008 global financial crisis, while Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the pandemic economic fallout might be worse. \n On Sunday (March 15), 190 new Covid-19 cases had been confirmed in Malaysia alone, the largest single-day increase in the number of confirmed cases. \n Meanwhile, China has logged more than 80,800 cases, but most patients have recovered and there are now fewer than 10,000 infected people. \n The country’s progress contrasts with the growing crisis abroad, with the worldwide death toll surpassing 6,000 as Italy recorded its biggest one-day rise in fatalities. \n With 368 deaths, Italy’s grim figure was higher than any single-day toll reported in China.

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — Following an increase in imported Covid-19 cases from European countries, Singapore will deny entry to new visitors who have been to Italy, France, Spain and Germany in the last two weeks, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Friday (March 13). \n From 11.59pm on Sunday, such visitors will also not be allowed to transit through Singapore, the ministry added. \n Singaporeans are also advised to defer all non-essential travel to the four countries as they have seen “very high numbers of cases and very high rates of increase”, MOH said in a statement. \n And with immediate effect, all travellers who show symptoms of fever or respiratory illness and who thus have to undergo a Covid-19 swab test at Singapore’s checkpoints will have to serve a 14-day stay-home notice, during which time they cannot leave their place of residence at all.  \n They will have to serve the stay-home notice in full even if the result of the swab test is negative, MOH said. \n From 11.59 pm on Sunday, Singaporeans, permanent residents and long-term pass holders with travel history to the four countries within the last 14 days will be issued with a stay-home notice. Those issued the notice will have to stay home at all times for 14 days after returning to Singapore. \n Singapore will also cease port calls for all cruise vessels with immediate effect, the ministry added.  \n The latest round of stepped up border controls comes after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Covid-19 a pandemic on Wednesday, as the coronavirus has infected more than 125,000 people in 118 countries, and killed more than 4,000. \n WHO's chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a news conference in Geneva, Switzerland that in the last two weeks alone, cases outside China have increased 13-fold and the number of affected countries has tripled. \n MOH said that as of March 12, almost 25 per cent of the confirmed cases in Singapore were imported.  \n In the last 10 days alone, there have been 23 imported cases, making up nearly a third of all new cases, including 13 people with travel history to European countries and six from Indonesia. \n Speaking at a media briefing on Friday, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said: “We've said before that as we get further into the epidemic and as it becomes a global pandemic, increasingly border control measures may become less effective because we cannot identify specific countries. \n “But at this stage of the epidemic, we still see very high numbers and rapid increases in a few specific countries, especially in Europe. We are also seeing more imported cases recently, and that's why we think there is still a need to tighten border measures… in order to limit imported cases in Singapore.” \n He added that Singapore needs more “rigorous surveillance at our borders”. \n “Beyond specific countries, both previous and new ones we introduce today… (we are) concerned about countries with few reported cases of the virus. \n Mr Wong said these include neighbouring countries such as Indonesia, from which Singapore has had six imported cases, and Malaysia, where two Singaporeans attended a recent event and were diagnosed with Covid-19 after their return. \n Also speaking at the briefing, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong added that two days ago, Singapore saw its highest number of imported cases since the outbreak began.  \n “Control measures remain important to lower the risk of imported cases, (but) even as we continue to tighten border control, we know it would not be tenable for us to close borders to every affected country and region, and shut ourselves out,” he added. \n “We need to ensure measures are sustainable in the long term and life can go on.” \n Asked if the border restrictions were prompted by the move by the United States to ban travellers from European countries, Mr Wong said: “Our measures, social distancing or travel restrictions, are informed by data, evidence and expert advice, not based on what other countries are doing.” \n He added: “How long can we go on with this? We know what our limits are. If infection spreads at a rapid rate all over the world, continuing on this path would effectively shut Singapore out from the world and we don’t want to get there.” \n Mr Wong said that at some point, Singapore would want to shift to a different approach for border surveillance.  \n “If indeed we are moving in that direction, there will be a limit to how many countries we impose travel restrictions on and we will need a different way of doing border surveillance.” \n MOH also issued a list of countries and regions with known and potential exported cases, and is advising Singaporeans to exercise caution when travelling to these places. \n Mainland China \n Egypt \n France \n Germany \n Hong Kong \n India \n Italy \n Indonesia \n Iran \n Israel \n Japan \n Malaysia \n Philippines \n Republic of Korea \n Spain \n Thailand \n United Kingdom \n United States \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "UNITED NATIONS - A female diplomat from the Philippines mission to the United Nations tested positive for coronavirus on Thursday, according to a note sent to U.N. missions, making the woman the first known case at the world body's New York headquarters.  \n \"As of today, the Philippine Mission is in lockdown, and all personnel are instructed to self-quarantine and to seek medical attention should they develop the symptoms. We are assuming that all of us have been infected,\" wrote Philippines acting U.N. Ambassador Kira Azucena in a message seen by Reuters.  \n According to the online U.N. directory of diplomatic staff, there are about 12 diplomats at the Filipino mission, which is on 5th Avenue in Midtown Manhattan.  \n The Philippines Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin posted on Twitter that the diplomat was young, spritely and \"doing well,\" adding that she had recently returned from Florida.  \n The sick diplomat represented the Philippines in the U.N. General Assembly's legal affairs committee. Azucena said the diplomat was last at U.N. headquarters on Monday for about half an hour when she was asymptomatic.  \n She came down with flu-like symptoms on Tuesday and visited her doctor. \"She got the call today that she tested positive for COVID-19,\" Azucena wrote on Thursday.  \n U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the Filipino diplomat met with two other diplomats and visited only one U.N. meeting room, which had been cleaned three times since Monday. He said the U.N. medical services was contacting those diplomats.  \n Several U.N. meetings planned for Friday had been cancelled in the wake of the diagnosis, diplomats said.  \n The 193-member world body began implementing coronavirus prevention measures at its Manhattan headquarters this week, including closing off access to the public, more regular cleaning and cancelling some meetings. Half the several thousand U.N. staff who normally work in the building will work from home by next week.  \n The World Health Organization has described the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic. The virus, which has been deadly for some people, broke out in China's Wuhan city late last year and has so far infected some 125,000 people from 118 countries and territories. According to a Reuters tally it has killed 4,700. REUTERS \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "BEIJING — A spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry suggested on Thursday (March 12) the US military might have brought the coronavirus to the Chinese city of Wuhan, which has been hardest hit by the outbreak, doubling down on a war of words with Washington. \n China has taken great offence at comments by US officials accusing it of being slow to react to the virus, first detected in Wuhan late last year, and of not being transparent enough. \n On Wednesday, US National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien said the speed of China's reaction to the emergence of the coronavirus had probably cost the world two months when it could have been preparing for the outbreak. \n In a strongly worded tweet, written in English on his verified Twitter account, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said it was the United States that lacked transparency. \n \"When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!\" Mr Zhao wrote. \n Mr Zhao, an avid and often combative Twitter user, did not offer any evidence for his suggestion that the US military might be to blame for the outbreak in China. \n Earlier on Thursday, Zhao's fellow Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang criticised US officials for \"immoral and irresponsible\" comments that blamed Beijing's response to the coronavirus for worsening the global impact of the pandemic. \n Asked about O'Brien's comments, Mr Geng told a daily news briefing in Beijing on that such remarks by US officials would not help US epidemic efforts. \n China's efforts to slow the spread had bought the world time to prepare against the epidemic, he added. \n \"We wish that a few officials in the US would at this time concentrate their energy on responding to the virus and promoting cooperation, and not on shifting the blame to China.\" \n FIRM MEASURES \n The coronavirus emerged in December in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province, where around two-thirds of global cases so far have been recorded. But in recent weeks the vast majority of new cases have been outside China. \n The Chinese authorities credit firm measures they took in January and February, including to a near total shutdown of Hubei, for preventing outbreaks in other Chinese cities on the scale of Wuhan and slowing the spread abroad. \n The administration of US President Donald Trump has pointed to a decision to limit air travel from China at the end of January to fend off criticism that it responded too slowly to the disease. Critics say Mr Trump played down the disease in public and the federal government was slow to roll out tests. \n \"Unfortunately, rather than using best practices, this outbreak in Wuhan was covered up,\" Mr Trump's national security advisor Mr O'Brien said during a think-tank appearance on Wednesday. \n \"It probably cost the world community two months to respond,\" during which \"we could have dramatically curtailed what happened both in China and what's now happening across the world\", he said. \n More than 119,100 people have been infected by the novel coronavirus across the world and 4,298 have died, the vast majority in China, according to a Reuters tally. The United States has 975 cases and 30 people have died. \n \"We have done a good job responding to it but ... the way that this started out in China, and the way it was handled from the outset, was not right,\" said Mr O'Brien.  REUTERS  \n For the latest on the Covid-19 pandemic: https://tdy.sg/covid19  \n Join our Telegram channel to get TODAY's top stories on mobile: https://t.me/todayonlinesg  \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Europe is now the epicentre of the pandemic. The online newspaper \"Politico\" gave a comprehensive guide to the measures being taken by European countries to deal with Covid-19. Portugal, which is part of this ranking, is one of the countries that has already implemented exceptional measures and is in a state of alert: schools and universities are closed and events in enclosure covered with more than a thousand prohibited people. But if the disease gets out of hand, the government is likely to go ahead with even more restrictive measures. Look at what is happening in Europe, country by country:\nItaly\nThe second country in the world most affected by the disease, after China, has all schools, universities, shops and restaurants closed until at least three in April, with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies. And people can only leave the house for reasons considered to be of prime need. Anyone who wants to travel from one city to another must have a completed form about the reasons for the journey. Any false information provided to the authorities is considered a crime. Major events such as shows and football games are suspended. The degree of panic among the population is considered by the high politician.\nJON NAZCA\nSpain\nAll Spaniards were restricted by being forced to stay home because of Covid-19. A decision this Saturday by Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. As in Italy, they can only leave the house if they are buying first-needed products, medicines in a pharmacy or if they need to go to a hospital. The country lives in a state of alarm for the second time in democracy. And all the police and armed forces were mobilized. All flights to and from Italy were cancelled and thousands of passengers were stranded at Madrid and Barcelona airports after some countries closed their doors to people from flights from SpainYeah. All the Spanish regions closed schools and universities, with almost ten million students staying home for two weeks. The degree of panic is greater in affected areas such as Madrid, where people line up in supermarkets.\nFrance\nIt's another country with more cases. The non-urgent surgeries have been postponed so as to give priority to patients with the new coronavirus. People arriving from the five most affected countries are quarantined. Air France's flights to and from Italy were suspended until the third of April. Schools, universities and kindergartens were closed and your reading visits suspended. Events with over a thousand people, such as the Paris Marathon, were banned. Public transport is still operating. The government decided to help big business by postponing tax payments. The degree of fear among the population is slightly lower than in Italy and Spain.\nGermany\nBorder controls have been stepped up since Tuesday. Travels to the most affected countries have been discouraged by the government. Some of the most affected states decided to shut down schools and ban shows with over a thousand people. Many of the sporting events continue to take place but behind closed doors. This Friday, the government announced that it will give unlimited credit to companies by injecting fifty billion euros into the economy. Civil Protection has a pre-Covid-19 guide on food stocks, suggesting that the Germans should keep food like bread, potatoes or nuts. It also suggests the storage of 20-litres of liquids per person, preferably bottled. The country also allows trucks to move on German roads on Sundays. The level of panic is high, although few deaths have been reported in comparison to the number of infected.\nDenmark\nThe government has pressured hospitals and homes to impose restrictive measures regarding visits. Visits to Italy, Iran, South Korea or ChinaYeah. And those returning from those regions should be quarantined for four days. Flights to Italy and some regions of China were suspended until the end of April. Schools are closed for two weeks and events with over a hundred participants cancelled.

Primary and secondary schools remain open and in universities teachers are advised to teach online classes in classes with more than 100 students. Events with more than a hundred people were canceled as well as museums and theaters. Entrepreneurs with financial problems as well as small businesses will be helped.

At a later stage of the emergency plan, when Covid-19 peak is reached, older and vulnerable people will be advised to isolate themselves for several weeks. Schools only close if there are infected students or teachers. But two cases have already been confirmed at Oxford and Bournemouth universities, but the institutions have remained open. Sports events have not been cancelled but many of them are fighting behind closed doors. And the government has made efforts not to shut down the live shows. 12 billion pounds and tax cuts were injected to mitigate the effect of the new coronavirus. The level of alert among the population is average, appreciably equal to that of the Germans and the Netherlands.Yeah.\nBelgium\nNot all tourists returning from holiday in Italy have been quarantined. The flights to that country have since been cancelled. All schools have been shut down but will provide support to the children of the country who work in the health sector. All recreational activities have been cancelled, such as restaurants and bars. Shops deemed \"non-essential\" have to be closed by the weekend. The population is advised to work from home and older people not to leave home. It is asked to avoid riding public transport at rush hour.

There is some visible concern among the population.\nDAVID W CERNY\nCzech Republic\nThe government declared the state of emergency for thirty days. People who have had contact with patients are quarantined. Borders have been closed and closed for people coming from fifteen countries at risk. Czech citizens cannot travel to those same countries either. Schools are closed and events with more than thirty banned participants. Restaurants have to be closed between eight and six in the morning. Gyms, pools, discos, bars or bookstores are closed. The alert level among the population is high.\nSlovenia\nParents may not be present at childbirth in maternity homes. And visitors aren't allowed in hospitals.

And the sporting events suspended for the same period. The shopping centers are closed on weekends, with only supermarkets and pharmacies open. The alert level among the population is high.\nThe same is true in countries such as Ireland, Poland and Romania, which are subject to restrictive measures to contain the virus. Sweden, Finland, Luxembourg, Croatia and Estonia have lower alert levels, some because they have few cases of infected people, others because they are far from the most affected countries.",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — As Singapore steps up the battle against Covid-19, with the outbreak still largely contained, some people living here are worried about their relatives in corners of the globe that are suffering the worst death tolls from the virus outside China. \n These people — originally from Italy, Iran and South Korea — are glued to their television and mobile phone screens, constantly refreshing their social media feeds for the latest news back home, where the death toll has risen alarmingly in recent weeks. \n For some of them, the anxiety of being so far from loved ones at such a difficult time has been made harder by insensitive humour over Covid-19 on social media. \n Italy has more than 2,000 Covid-19 cases, with a death toll of 52. In Iran, 66 people have died, with reported infections topping 1,500. And in South Korea, 28 people have died with more than 5,000 cases reported. \n The Ministry of Health said on Tuesday (March 3) that all new visitors who have travelled to Iran, northern Italy or South Korea within the last 14 days will not be allowed to enter Singapore from 11:59pm on Wednesday, after the World Health Organization named these three countries, alongside Japan, as the ones of greatest concern in the fight against Covid-19. \n Ms Hayedeh, 50, who declined to give her family name, moved to Singapore from Iran more than 30 years ago. She feels “helpless” about the situation in Iran. \n “When the virus started in Singapore, I took it a lot better because I saw how Singapore handled Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003). I don’t feel worried because I know I am in good hands. The Government is taking care of everything in an amazing way,” the home chef, who is a permanent resident, said. \n “But I’m worried for them (in Iran) because it’s a huge country. The number of people and awareness is different.”  \n Mr Mohammad Jafari, 56, a businessman who moved to Singapore from Iran in 1993 shares the same sentiments. \n “When the virus started spreading here, my brother (in Iran) told me to be careful. They were worried because Singapore is close to China and many Chinese people visit Singapore. I told them not to worry because Singapore has the situation under control, implementing effective quarantine measures,” Mr Jafari, who has been a Singapore citizen for more than 15 years, said. \n Ms Hayedeh remains worried about her friends and family who are avoiding social gatherings and staying home, but she refrains from calling them “more than usual” because she does not want to “give them stress or anxiety.” \n A sense of excitement that should be felt with the Iranian New Year, or Nowruz, being just around the corner on March 20, is replaced by largely empty roads and even emptier stores there. \n Ms Hayedeh said: “No one has the mood to go out to shop. Like Chinese New Year, before Nowruz, everybody goes out to shop, buy new clothes, food, sweets and house decorations. Businesses are very affected.” \n Researcher Alireza Javadian, 34, who is here on an employment pass, said: “Many travel agencies that sold tour packages to visitors hoping to go to Iran to celebrate the new year received a lot of cancellations.” \n  \n Mr Alireza Javadian, an Iranian who is a researcher on an employment pass in Singapore, during a visit to Cambodia. Photo: Alireza Javadian \n Ms Hayedeh thinks that Nowruz will be celebrated “in a different manner” this year. “Usually on Nowruz, we gather and hug and kiss but this year, they cannot even do that anymore,” she said. \n 'SAD FOR PEOPLE IN SOUTH KOREA' \n Ms Kim Ye Sing, 24, who is a Singaporean permanent resident, said that both the Singaporean and South Korean authorities are handling the outbreak well. She also said that living here made her realise \"how ready Singapore is to fight and protect its people”. \n She used to work as a flight cabin crew and is moving to the banking field. \n “I’m very sure the government in South Korea also did the best it could to contain the virus but it was already spreading so quickly,” she said. \n “The official in charge of managing Covid-19 even commited suicide. It just shows how troubled the official was.” \n She added: “I feel really worried and sad for my people in (South Korea). I hope things will get better soon.” \n Two weeks ago, a South Korean undergraduate, Ms Eunbin Cho, 22, had to cancel her flight to Seoul on March 11 to visit her family there but could not obtain a refund because there were no official travel restrictions at that time. \n She said that she is worried about her family being there as the number of infections keep going up. \n “Today I saw that there were five new cases at the exact location where my grandparents and parents are living, in Gangnam (a district in Seoul). It’s so bad,” she told TODAY on Monday. “There are confirmed cases everywhere.” \n Ms Cho said that she is deeply saddened by the situation in South Korea and was upset to see comments on Facebook making jokes about it. \n On a Facebook page of a Singapore media outlet, she found comments that were \"very bad\", trying to be funny and saying things such as \"Train to Daegu\", an apparent reference to Train to Busan, a Korean zombie film. \n “But it’s not funny at all,” she said. “They keep making fun of it by saying it’s like a Korean drama. It’s quite hurtful for me to read it because they’re taking it as a joke.” \n Television producer Christine Park, 25, a Singapore permanent resident, said that more people are avoiding crowded places in Seoul. \n “My relatives are scared, they won't leave the house much and won’t eat out. My cousin in fourth grade usually has piano, taekwondo classes but is not going to go for them anymore.” \n 'BUSINESSES CLOSING EARLY IN ITALY' \n Writer Edoardo Liotta, 23, who has been in Singapore since he was a year old, said that he was worried about his family in Italy. \n Most of Mr Liotta’s family members live in Rome, but his cousin lives in Milan which is a major hotspot for Covid-19. \n “I text my cousin in Milan more often because she is much closer to the outbreak areas. She has had to work from home and all big gatherings have been cancelled,” Mr Liotta said. \n He added that the situation is being handled well by the Italian authorities. \n “Generally, I think the (Italian government) is doing really well considering they did the most tests compared to any other European country,” he said. \n “They were fast to lock down towns that had outbreaks. The city of Milan has been quite empty to reduce transmission and there are roadblocks and many other efforts in place.” \n Another Italian on an employment pass who wants to be known only as Mr Francesco, 28, subscribes to the Gov.sg WhatsApp channel and thinks that direct channels of information are a good way to help the Singapore Government coordinate communication to the public. \n “The channel helps people to understand the situation better which helps reduce panic,” he said, adding that officials in Italy disseminate information only through the media. \n Friends and relatives in Italy tell him that some businesses are closing earlier there as the Covid-19 crisis deepens. \n “Some bars are closed after 6pm to avoid crowds, so are theatres and clubs,” he said, adding that restaurants have not closed because only crowded places will be closed in the evening. \n Mr Alan Serrecchia, 40, a sales manager on an employment pass here, also said that the Italian government is managing the outbreak well but he hopes that this health crisis will all end quickly. \n “I hope that it will be over soon for everyone,” he added “And I hope that we can endure this situation.” \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — After placing an order at a restaurant in Seoul, freelancer Elizabeth Toh, 30, was told by a waiter that she could not dine in.  \n “The waiter told me he was sorry but the boss did not want to accept foreigners,” she said. “I was shocked, but I understand why they are doing this.” \n Ms Toh is one of five Singaporeans living in South Korea who spoke to TODAY about what it has been like to witness firsthand a country grappling with a Covid-19 crisis that is second only to China’s.  \n With over 2,000 confirmed cases, South Korea has the highest number of Covid-19 patients outside China and its death toll has passed 10.  \n These Singaporeans, including one living in Daegu, the epicentre of the outbreak, said that while life is mostly going on as per normal, supermarket shelves are emptier, deliveries are taking longer and there is a heightened sense of fear in the air, marked by a touch of suspicion of foreigners.  \n Ms Toh, who has been in Korea since last August, said she has been seeing signs saying “No Foreigners” at restaurants in Seoul since last week.  \n But apart from that, the city’s dwellers have not discriminated against her or indulged in any panicked behaviour, she said. \n “Everyone here is still calm. They just have started to take notice of their hygiene more by washing their hands more often and wearing masks.” \n Ms Toh, who is currently enrolled in a language exchange programme at the Geumgang University in Daejeon, said her parents are worried about her remaining in Korea, but she is choosing to stay as she is not too worried about the situation there now.  \n Another Singaporean who has been living in South Korea is homeschool teacher Syasya Luna, who said that supermarket shelves are emptier in her city of Mapo-Gu.  \n “There are few packets of rice and ramen on the shelves,” said the 21-year-old, who has been living in South Korea for the past three years. “You need to go early in the morning to the stores to buy them.” \n She added that online grocery delivery sites such as G-market is also overwhelmed with orders and now take two days to deliver packages, where before they would have done so within a day.  \n But Koreans have not been hoarding or panic-buying, she said. \n “People are buying one, maybe two basketfuls (of groceries),” she said. “Not trolleys of stuff.” \n Ms Luna also described emptier streets when she visited Hongdae, a popular shopping district in Seoul.  \n “The streets are almost like a ghost town now,” she said. “Usually any day of the year it’s filled with tourists and the traffic is crazy.”  \n In the high-end Gangnam district, some schools, offices, shopping malls and a public library have closed for the time being, she added.  \n The rapidly intensifying outbreak has her worried, she admitted. \n “It’s so sudden. In one day the numbers (of confirmed Covid-19 cases) climbed to 200 and the next day when I opened my eyes it reached about 800,” she said. “I’ve also become paranoid, even when I’m lightheaded I will go and have it checked.”  \n She said that her parents have also been worried. \n “My parents call me everyday and ask me to come back,” she said, adding that her mother has even cried over the phone once. \n But she intends to remain in South Korea, as she has to complete her teaching contract with the family she works for, which lasts till the end of July.  \n LIFE IN THE EPICENTRE \n In Daegu, which has over 60 per cent of South Korea’s confirmed cases, Singaporean engineer Godfrey Ho, 33, said life has not changed all that much. \n More people are wearing masks in public and avoiding large group gatherings, and about a third of the shops and businesses in the city since the outbreak began, he said. \n “More people are choosing not to leave their homes,” he said, adding that there are also fewer cars on the roads. \n Some kindergartens and schools there have closed as well but most people are still going to work, he said. \n Unlike in Mapo-Gu, supermarkets in Daegu remain fully stocked and food and grocery deliveries also seem to be operating as usual without much delay, he added. \n “People don’t panic buy,” he said. “Maybe some panic bought ramen but there are always more on the shelves.” \n Mr Ho is not worried about the situation there and intends to stay put as he is taking the necessary health precautions.  \n “I am frankly not worried,” he said. “I definitely take precautions such as not hanging out downtown and when I’m queuing I usually leave a space between me and the other person.” \n He has also started wearing a mask everyday and avoids going out often. He has stopped going for his usual Friday night dinners with friends since last week and has been working from home.  \n He added that if he were to fly back home, he might be exposing himself to the virus even more. \n “I don’t want to be on the plane with people when I don’t know where they have been,” he said. “I’m trying to avoid being close to people.” \n He also added that his family members in Singapore are worried about him being there, but added: “They know that I know how to take the necessary precautions.” \n — Additional reporting by Matthew Loh \n   \n ",

This will probably continue for some time\", according to the OECD, noting that Chinese tourists represent about 10% of international tourism.\nThe organization chaired by A ngel Gurria further argues in its report that \"stimulation of macroeconomic policy in the most exposed economies will help restore confidence as the effects of the virus outbreak and supply-side disruptions fade\".\n\"Low interest rates should help cushion demand despite the impact of recent and projected changes in interest rate policy on [economic] activity should remain modest in advanced economies,\" according to the OECD.\nIn both China and the most affected economies, the OECD recommends that in the short term banks, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, provide'liquidity to the financial system', and not allow companies to go bankrupt during the implementation of measures to contain the outbreak",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — To help the hospitality and tourism-related businesses stay afloat during the Covid-19 outbreak, consumers who are not sick should still dine out, a representative of online travel firm Asia Expedia Group said.  \n “Go out, travel, eat,” Mr Ang Choo Pin, the group’s senior director, said. “Right now is the time for plenty of very good deals.  \n “I've noticed that some of the best restaurants where it was hard to get a reservation for, it's now getting easier. \n “Singaporeans love staycations… and some hotels are offering great deals.” \n His remarks were made during a panel discussion hosted by Singapore’s American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham), which released a business survey on Wednesday (Feb 26) showing that the travel and hospitality industries here have been impacted by the Covid-19 outbreak the most. \n Done between Feb 12 and 18 and opened to AmCham Singapore members in these industries, the online survey aimed to understand the outbreak’s impact on companies’ operations, the business environment in Singapore, and the outlook on the region. \n Of the 225 firms that took the survey, 78 per cent of them reported that the coronavirus outbreak has had an extensive or moderate impact on their business operations — both within Singapore and the broader Asia-Pacific. \n For those in the hospitality and travel sector, this figure was 88 per cent. The survey also found that half of those in this sector are expecting more than 20 per cent losses in revenue. \n Analysts told TODAY earlier this month that Singapore’s tourism sector is likely to take a hit in the next six to eight months. \n A fifth of the international visitors here are from China, and visitors who have travelled to China in the past 14 days are banned from entering Singapore during this period. \n As of Wednesday, Singapore is the country with the fifth-highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases outside China — after South Korea, Italy, Japan and Iran. \n The governments of India, Israel, Kuwait, Qatar and South Korea have advised their citizens to avoid non-essential travel to Singapore as well.  \n However, Mr Ang of Asia Expedia Group is staying positive and hopeful that things will look up for these industries. \n “One thing we have to bear in mind is that tourism has traditionally been a very resilient industry,” he said. \n Referring to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak in 2003 that was caused by a coronavirus, he recalled how the number of arrivals of tourists dropped to 4.7 million but went up to 7 million just two years later. \n “That’s a 40 per cent increase and it rebounded to an extent that was even greater than pre-Sars, so I think it kind of tells you how this might go.” \n CONFIDENCE IN SINGAPORE AS BUSINESS HUB  \n The upside is that the AmCham survey showed that 98 per cent of the firms still have long-term confidence in Singapore as a business hub and destination.  \n A key reason for this is due to the Government’s handling of the outbreak.  \n An overwhelming 97 per cent of the firms in the survey said that the Government has been effective in communicating health and safety updates with regards to the outbreak, while 79 per cent of the firms said that the Government has been effective in addressing the potential economic impact of this public health crisis.  \n SCENARIO PLANNING FOR BUSINESSES \n Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Trade and Industry who was present at the AmCham event, said during a dialogue session that there are three key scenarios Singapore could possibly face in the coming weeks and months. \n Scenario 1  The impact from the outbreak is sharp but there is a “very quick recovery”.  \n This was the case with Sars when the mortality rate was 10 per cent but the outbreak did not last long. The first infected patient landed in Singapore in March 2003 and the country was declared Sars-free in May by the World Health Organization.  \n However, this scenario is unlikely because the Covid-19 coronavirus is infectious but the mortality is very low. Outside of China, less than 1 per cent of patients have died.  \n So this outbreak may last longer than one that has a very high mortality rate. \n Scenario 2 \n The virus takes some time to be eradicated.  \n Mr Chan said: “We must be prepared that if need be, we must put in other measures to work with the businesses to overcome this crisis in a more prolonged time period that was originally envisaged.” \n He also said that Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat has already given Singaporeans the assurance that the Government is closely monitoring all measures in the next two to three months to see whether they should be adjusted according to the appropriate conditions and needs. \n Scenario 3 \n The virus mutates into something that causes symptoms similar to the seasonal flu, becoming endemic within the world's population.  \n Singapore may then have to deal with the virus in a similar way that it would a common flu. \n “And then we would then have to find ways to see how we can get back to normalcy (while still taking certain) precautions, Mr Chan said, without elaborating on what these precautions would be.  \n He emphasised that at this point, it is still too premature to say which of the three scenarios will likely take place, but businesses should begin “mental preparations” by using these scenarios to best position themselves for recovery. \n “For those of you who are familiar with the scenario-planning methodology, you will know that we are not trying to forecast which is the scenario.  \n “We are just trying to ask ourselves: If any of these three scenarios happen, are our businesses prepared to handle the consequences of that, and that is how we stress-test our business plan to see whether they are robust enough for the different scenarios.” \n STRENGTH IN UNITY  \n A key point that Mr Chan repeated a few times during the dialogue session was how businesses and Singaporeans need to band together as one. \n “We have to do this together. Big businesses have to help the small businesses and we all have to help each other. We need to have a sense that we are all in this together. \n “If the supply chain breaks, even if it's the smallest part of it, it disrupts the entire supply chain.  \n “In Singapore, we must also distinguish ourselves that unlike places elsewhere, it is not a situation whereby it’s every man for his own. There's a certain communitarian spirit in this, which is that we will get through this, we'll get through this together as one. In order to do that, we have to help each other,” he said. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "From one day to the next, the number of new confirmed cases of the coronavirus epidemic, now officially known as Covid-19, increased almost ten times and the number of deaths more than doubled in the Chinese province of Hubei.\nAccording to the newspaper \"South China Morning Post\", Hubei's health committee, epicenter of the virus, announced that the diagnostic criteria used to confirm new cases had changed, which means that doctors now have greater discretion in determining which patients are infected.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) spokesman Tarik Jaarevic told Expresso that the agency is \"monitoring the situation to get a clearer picture of recent developments in the definition and protocol followed by China in the disclosure of cases\". \"It is our current understanding that the new definition of cases extends the network, including not only confirmed cases in the laboratory, but also clinically diagnosed cases based on symptoms and exposure,\" he adds. \"The leap recorded reflects the most comprehensive definition,\" said the spokesman, ensuring that the WHO will share more information as it receives it.\nCovid-19 has spread to at least 24 countries, infecting 60.376 people around the world. The overwhelming majority of events continue to be recorded in mainland China: 59.804 cases and 1.370 deaths. In the overall number of deaths there is one death in the Philippines, another in the special administrative region of Hong Kong and a third in Japan, the second most affected country after China.\nMeanwhile, the purging of Communist Party leaders in Hubei by the central government of Beijing continues. The party secretary in the province, Jiang Chaoliang, was replaced by Shanghai Mayor, an ally close to the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, revealed the official Xinhua news agencYeah. Jiang is so far the highest-ranking political victim of the outbreak.\nThe leader of the party in the city of Wuhan (Hubei capital, where it is believed that the epidemic will have started in a seafood and meat market), Ma Guoqiang, has also lost his job, added Xinhua, and his place will be occupied by Wang Zhonglin, secretary of the party in the capital of Shandong province, Jinan.\nThe removal of the two leaders of the Communist Party follows the removal of the two leading health officials in Hubei earlier this week.\nThe changes are in line with Xi's message on Wednesday that progress had been made in controlling the outbreak and that, in most of the country, the focus should now be on getting back to work.\nThe WHO seems more cautious. \"The outbreak can still take any direction,\" said its Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who considered it to be \"too early\" to make predictions about the end of the epidemic.\nThe MS Westerdam cruise ship docked early this Thursday morning in Cambodia after being prevented from doing so in Japan, Taiwan, Guam (US island territory in Micronesia), the Philippines and Thailand due to fears related to the virus.\nThe Director-General of WHO praised the Cambodian authorities: \"This is an example of the international solidarity that we have consistently called for. Freaks can bring out the best and the worst in people. stigmatising entire individuals or nations does nothing but harm the answer.\"\nThe Diamond Princess ship, which is quarantined outside Yokohama, near Tokyo, continues to report more Covid-19 cases on board. In Japan, where up to now 248 cases of infection have been recorded, the first death was confirmed this Thursday, as announced by the Japanese Minister of Health, Katsunobu Kato. This is a woman about 80-year-old who was not on board that ship",

(https://www.reuters.com/live-events/coronavirus-6-id2921484) Here is what we know about the disease it causes and how it spreads:  \n  \n * Like other coronaviruses, the new virus - which causes a disease now called COVID-19 - is transmitted from person to person via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings.  \n * Scientists in China who studied swabs from infected patients say the new coronavirus behaves quite like flu viruses, suggesting it may spread more easily than previously thought.  \n * COVID-19 infection has an incubation period of between one and 14 days, and a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association has found new evidence that the virus can be spread asymptomatically.  \n * A World Health Organization-led team of investigating scientists in China has said that the epidemic there peaked between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2 and has been declining steadily since then.  \n * They also found that the case-fatality rate is between 2% and 4% in Wuhan and 0.7% outside Wuhan.  \n * Infectious disease and virus specialists estimate that each infected person in the epidemic is infecting, on average, two to three other people.  \n * The WHO said on Monday that the COVID-19 outbreak was not out of control globally and does not have a large-scale death toll, so it was \"too early\" to speak of a pandemic.  \n * Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Mild cases can cause cold-like symptoms, while severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness, kidney failure and death.  \n * Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that get their name from what they look like under a microscope - they are spherical and their surfaces are covered with \"crown\"-like spikes.  \n * Animal viruses can mutate or combine with other viruses to create new strains capable of being passed to people. Scientists say the new coronavirus originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via an intermediary animal species.  \n * Genetic data suggests the new coronavirus is the result of viral recombination - a process where more than one virus infects the same cell at the same time and creates a \"recombinant\" virus strain.

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — Although it is still far too early to say the worst is over, the Covid-19 outbreak appears to have tapered off in Singapore in the past week, several experts said on Friday (Feb 21), four weeks after the coronavirus was first confirmed here. \n However, there is a growing concern that further cases of the infection could arrive from countries outside China and disrupt this recent positive streak, four infectious health diseases experts said in giving their take on the broad Covid-19 picture to date. \n Since the peak of confirmed cases a week ago, when nine cases were confirmed here in one day, Feb 14, experts noted that the number of new cases detected has fallen steadily, although there is no way to be certain that another surge will not happen. \n On both Thursday and Friday only one new confirmed case of Covid-19 in Singapore was reported by the Ministry of Health (MOH). \n On Wednesday, three cases were reported, including a 57-year-old woman who had initially been admitted to hospital for dengue fever. It was later confirmed she had both Covid-19 and dengue. \n No new clusters of local transmission have been detected for several days and most of the latest cases can all be traced back to earlier ones. A large number of patients confirmed with the disease have been discharged from the hospitals where they had been isolated. \n “The hysteria will quieten down in the next month unless something unexpected happens,\" Professor Tikki Elka Pangestu, a visiting fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and a former director of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) research policy and co-operation department in Geneva told TODAY. \n \"But, as I have said, the virus will most likely remain in the population. In my view? Normalise everything and learn to live with the virus,” he added. \n Recent reports from China, where the disease Covid-19 originated, have suggested that new transmission of the virus that causes it, Sars-CoV-2, has also fallen dramatically over the last few days. \n Referring to this trend, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had said that Chinese data “appears to show a decline in new cases’’ but noted that any apparent trend “must be interpreted very cautiously”. \n Using data made available by the Singapore MOH, TODAY looked at how the pace of the Covid-19 outbreak has changed over the past four weeks since Case 1, a 66-year-old Wuhan resident who arrived in Singapore on Jan 20 and was confirmed with the disease on Jan 23. \n DOWNWARD TREND IN THE NUMBER OF CASES IN PAST WEEK \n  \n Looking at the daily number of confirmed cases, the Covid-19 situation appears to have slowed in the past week, with a sharp drop in the number of cases from the record of nine on Feb 14 to one confirmed case on Friday. \n Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Elizabeth Hospital, said it looks like the number of cases found on Feb 13 and 14, mostly arising from the Grace Assembly of God cluster, appears to be the peak of the outbreak in Singapore. \n \"The number of cases is coming down,” said Dr Leong. \n He noted that Singapore has been doing hundreds of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests per day — the test used to detect Covid-19 — and these cases must be seen in that context. \n “This means that we are truly looking for a needle in the haystack, which means the number of cases is truly low. There are very few, if not no cases of active transmission in Singapore,” he said. \n Agreeing with Dr Leong, Dr Pangestu said that the supposed peak outbreak here on Feb 14 is consistent with earlier scientific models that predicted that the number of new infections of the Covid-19 virus would peak in mid to late February. Chinese scientist Zhong Nanshan, the eminent 83-year-old epidemiologist who had discovered the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus, had given the same prediction as well. \n One study by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had predicted a February peak based on the basic reproductive number of Covid-19, which is the expected number of cases directly generated by one patient. For Covid-19, this number averages between 1.5 and 4.5. \n Biostatistician Alex Cook, who is the vice dean of research at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said it is “certainly a good thing that the number of cases has been going down”. \n “(This falling trend) reflects the cases to identify and be isolated, and the efforts of MOH to conduct contact tracing, and healthcare workers to minimise infection in hospitals,” said Associate Professor Cook, who is the domain leader for biostatistics and modelling at the school. \n His colleague, Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, the school’s programme leader of infectious diseases and the co-director of global health, added that the fall in the number of confirmed cases in the past week indicates that Singapore’s efforts have been successful in limiting the spread of Covid-19. \n “It is likely that current massive contact tracing — initiated right at the start of the outbreak in Singapore — has led to the majority of cases being uncovered. Current quarantine and social distancing measures have also worked to reduce transmission in Singapore,” said Assoc Prof Hsu. \n FEWER NEW PRIMARY CASES DETECTED IN RECENT WEEKS \n  \n A key indicator is the number of primary cases found on a given day — patients who have had no known link to previous cases and could have contracted the virus through local transmission. \n Singapore upgraded its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) alert level to Orange on Feb 7 when it discovered another three such primary cases, including Case 32, a Victoria Junior College teacher who had no recent travel history to China and no known link to the earlier cases. \n While finding these primary cases helps the authorities discover new ones through contact-tracing, they also highlight that there are more unknowns about how the Covid-19 situation is spreading in the community, said experts. \n But in the past week, no new cluster and fewer primary cases have appeared. The exceptions are the recently discovered Case 82, a 57-year-old Singaporean who had contracted both dengue and Covid-19, and Case 85, a 35-year-old Chinese national who did not travel to China recently. \n As these cases were confirmed only recently, a link could be established later when more detailed contact tracing has taken place. \n Commenting on this trend of fewer primary cases in the past week, Prof Pangestu said he hoped this would help to calm the public. \n While it could also mean that potential primary cases are still hidden from view, it is unlikely as the Singapore Government has been “very vigilant” in contact tracing. The trend shows that infected people have been effectively detected, isolated and treated. \n “It’s the nature of these epidemics — they start explosively and then run out of steam as public health measures kick in and the virus runs out of susceptible hosts.” \n Dr Leong noted that with Singapore expanding its case definitions to screen all patients with pneumonia for Covid-19, it is unlikely that cases would fall under the radar. \n But Singapore’s strengths in contact tracing will still be limited by the ability for patients to recall where they have been and with whom they have interacted, which could account for those cases with no known links, he said. \n “Lousy recollection means lousy contact tracing, which leads to lousy curtailment. We need to think out of the box,” said Dr Leong, suggesting that there should be a mobile phone application that is able to help build Singapore’s capability in contact tracing in future. \n LARGE PORTION OF EARLIER CASES DISCHARGED \n  \n Experts also noted that a majority of the cases detected in the first two weeks of the outbreak have been discharged, a trend that is similar to the experience in other countries. This high rate of discharges is also a sign that the Covid-19 situation is improving in Singapore. \n As of Friday, 47 out of the 86 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. The number of cases in critical condition — five currently — has also come down. \n The number of discharged cases does not include Covid-19 patients who do not suffer from any symptoms throughout their infection but are still hospitalised. \n Assoc Prof Hsu noted that in this regard, data published out of China and other countries has been similar. \n “Covid-19 infections are mild for more than 80 per cent of patients, which means these patients would not have needed hospitalisation based on medical needs alone. The patients were kept isolated in hospital to minimise the risk that they would spread the virus to others in the community,” he said. \n While there is no known vaccine for the disease yet, in Singapore and elsewhere, Covid-19 patients are treated with a mix of antiviral drugs normally used for HIV cases, such as ritonavir and lopinavir. These have been promising, Professor Tan Chorh Chuan, MOH’s chief health scientist said previously. \n Besides Singapore becoming more adept at treating Covid-19, there is also the chance that the virus could be turning milder which would explain why the newer cases are not so severe, said Dr Leong. \n Of the cases in China, Covid-19 has a mortality rate of around 2.3 per cent. By comparison, Sars had a mortality rate of 9.6 per cent during the 2003 outbreak, while Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) has a fatality rate of 35 per cent. \n The mortality rate of Covid-19 outside China — based on a small number of deaths — is lower still, at around 0.2 per cent, which is similar to swine flu and slightly above the seasonal flu. \n Prof Pangestu added: “The implication of this? It simply proves that most cases of Covid-19 are not severe and people should not be unduly concerned. It’s just like the flu and Zika.” \n MAJORITY OF CASES WITH NO LINK TO CHINA \n  \n However, a concerning statistic has emerged in recent weeks: Cases that cannot be traced back to mainland China have now exceeded those with a known link to China, said experts. \n Dr Leong said while it is no cause for alarm, the fact that a majority of cases have no link to China shows how close Singapore came to losing the ability to contain the viral spread from China. \n He said strong contact tracing helped to rein in the numbers, otherwise the unknown cases would continue to mount. \n “The first round of infection comes from China. The second round comes from locals who were infected with contact with the Chinese. That is expected in any ongoing epidemic. It is crucial to keep the lid on the second group and we seem to have done it,” said Dr Leong. \n But the experts suggested that something more surreptitious could be at play given the mounting travel restrictions against China. There is a growing concern that undetected cases of Covid-19 may be entering Singapore from other countries. \n Said Dr Leong: “Within China, the numbers are coming down and it is good that viral spread in the source (country) is being controlled. But the more important question is those who have left China and seeded to countries with less resources — can they take the heat?” \n Covid-19 cases outside China are growing at an accelerating rate. The number of new cases detected outside China climbed at a steady rate since Feb 7, and crossed the threshold of 100 new daily cases for the first time on Feb 17 and has remained high ever since. \n While the number of imported cases of Covid-19 in Singapore has been negligible after Singapore put in place border control measures, Assoc Prof Cook predicts that this could climb again, with increasing numbers of imports from other countries seeding more clusters in Singapore. \n “In normal times there is a lot of travel to and from Singapore and places like Japan and Thailand, both of which have quite large numbers of confirmed cases,” he said. \n Given Singapore’s close proximity and connections to Malaysia and Indonesia, Assoc Prof Cook said he is also concerned about the risk of future importation from these two nations.

        "news_content_translate_cn": "新加坡——尽管说最坏的情况已经过去还为时过早，但几位专家周五（2月21日）表示，在冠状病毒首次在新加坡被证实4周后，Covid-19在新加坡的爆发似乎在过去一周逐渐减弱。\n然而，四位传染病专家在介绍迄今为止广泛的Covid-19照片时说，人们越来越担心，更多的感染病例可能来自中国以外的国家，并破坏最近的这种积极势头。\n自一周前确诊病例高峰出现以来，2月14日一天内这里确诊9例，专家指出，新发现病例数量稳步下降，但无法确定不会再次出现激增。\n周四和周五，新加坡卫生部（MOH）仅报告了一例Covid-19新确诊病例。\n星期三，报告了三个病例，其中包括一名57岁的妇女，她最初因登革热入院。后来证实她同时患有Covid-19和登革热。\n几天来没有发现新的本地传输集群，最新的大多数病例都可以追溯到早期病例。大量确诊患有此病的病人已从隔离的医院出院。\n李光耀公共政策学院（Lee Kuan-Yew School of Public Policy）访问学者、世界卫生组织（世卫组织）日内瓦研究政策与合作部前主任蒂基·艾尔卡·潘盖斯托教授今天表示：“除非发生意外，否则歇斯底里症将在下个月平息下来。”。\n“但是，正如我所说，这种病毒很可能仍然存在于人群中。在我看来？使一切正常化，学会与病毒共存，”他补充说.\nCovid-19病毒的发源地中国最近的报告显示，导致它的新病毒Sars-CoV-2在过去几天也急剧下降。\n在谈到这一趋势时，世卫组织总干事特德罗·阿德南姆·盖布雷耶苏曾表示，中国的数据“似乎显示新病例有所下降”，但他指出，任何明显的趋势“都必须非常谨慎地加以解释”。\n利用新加坡卫生部提供的数据，今天研究了自1号病例（66岁武汉居民，于1月20日抵达新加坡，并于1月23日确诊患有该病）以来，Covid-19疫情爆发的速度在过去四周内发生了怎样的变化。\n上周病例数下降趋势\n从每日确诊病例数来看，Covid-19的情况在过去一周似乎有所放缓，病例数从2月14日的9例锐减至周五的1例确诊病例。\n伊丽莎白山医院传染病专家梁浩南博士说，2月13日和14日发现的病例数量，似乎是新加坡爆发疫情的高峰期，这些病例大多来自上帝集团的恩典大会。\n“病例数量正在下降，”梁医生说。\n他指出，新加坡每天都要进行数百次聚合酶链反应（PCR）检测，这种检测方法用于检测Covid-19，这些病例必须在这种情况下才能看到。\n“这意味着我们正在大海捞针，这意味着案件数量确实很低。在新加坡，即使没有主动传播的病例，也很少。”。\n潘杰图博士同意梁振英博士的观点，他说，2月14日在这里出现的爆发高峰与先前的科学模型相一致，后者预测Covid-19病毒的新感染人数将在2月中下旬达到高峰. 83岁的著名流行病学家、发现Sars病毒的中国科学家钟南山也给出了同样的预测。\n伦敦卫生和热带医学院的一项研究根据Covid-19的基本生殖数量预测了2月份的高峰，这是一名患者直接产生的预期病例数。对于Covid-19，这个数字平均在1.5到4.5之间。\n生物统计学家亚历克斯·库克（Alex Cook）是Saw-Swee-Hock公共卫生学院的副院长，他说“病例数量下降无疑是件好事”。\n“这一下降趋势反映了需要识别和隔离的病例，以及卫生部进行接触追踪的努力，以及医护人员减少医院感染的努力，”库克副教授说，他是该校生物统计学和建模领域的负责人。\n他的同事、该校传染病项目负责人、全球卫生联合主任徐立扬副教授补充说，过去一周确诊病例数量的下降表明，新加坡在限制Covid-19的传播方面取得了成功。\n“目前的大规模接触追踪很可能是在新加坡疫情爆发之初就开始的，导致大多数病例被发现。目前的隔离和社会隔离措施也有助于减少在新加坡的传播。\n近几周新发现的原发病例较少\n一个关键的指标是在一天内发现的原发性病例的数量，这些病例与以前的病例没有已知的联系，并且可能通过本地传播感染了病毒.\n新加坡在2月7日将疾病爆发反应系统状态（Dorscon）警报级别提升至橙色，发现了另外三个这样的主要病例，其中包括病例32，一名维多利亚初级学院教师，他最近没有到中国旅行的历史，也与之前的病例没有已知联系。\n专家说，虽然发现这些主要病例有助于当局通过接触者追踪发现新病例，但他们也强调，关于Covid-19的情况如何在社区蔓延，还有更多的未知因素。\n但在过去的一周里，没有新的病例群出现，原发病例减少。例外情况是最近发现的病例82，一名57岁的新加坡人感染了登革热和Covid-19，病例85，一名35岁的中国公民，最近没有到中国旅行。\n由于这些病例只是最近才得到确认，因此在以后进行更详细的接触追踪时可以建立联系。\n在评论过去一周初审案件减少的趋势时，潘基斯托教授说，他希望这将有助于平息公众情绪。\n虽然这也可能意味着潜在的原发病例仍被隐藏在视线之外，但由于新加坡政府在接触追踪方面一直“非常警惕”，因此可能性不大。这一趋势表明，已对感染者进行了有效的检测、隔离和治疗。\n“这是这些流行病的本质——随着公共卫生措施的启动，病毒从易感宿主身上消失，它们开始爆炸，然后失去动力。”\n梁振英博士指出，随着新加坡扩大病例定义，对所有肺炎患者进行Covid-19筛查，病例不太可能落入关注范围。\n但他说，新加坡在接触追踪方面的优势仍将受到患者回忆曾经去过的地方和与谁互动的能力的限制，这可能会解释那些没有已知联系的病例。\n“糟糕的回忆意味着糟糕的接触追踪，导致糟糕的缩减. 我们需要跳出框框思考，”梁振英博士说，他建议未来应该有一个手机应用程序，能够帮助新加坡建立联系追踪的能力。\n大部分早期病例已出院\n专家们还指出，在疫情爆发前两周发现的病例中，大多数已经出院，这一趋势与其他国家的经验类似。这种高放电率也是新加坡Covid-19状况正在改善的一个迹象。\n截至上周五，86例患者中有47例已完全痊愈出院。目前情况危急的病例有5例也有所下降。\n出院病例数不包括Covid-19名患者，他们在感染过程中没有任何症状，但仍在住院治疗。\n许教授指出，在这方面，中国和其他国家公布的数据是相似的。\n“对80%以上的患者来说，Covid-19感染是轻微的，这意味着这些患者不需要仅仅根据医疗需要住院治疗。这些病人在医院被隔离，以尽量减少他们将病毒传播给社区其他人的风险。”。\n虽然在新加坡和其他地方还没有这种疾病的已知疫苗，但Covid-19患者接受的是通常用于艾滋病毒病例的抗病毒药物的混合治疗，如利托那韦和洛匹那韦。卫生部首席卫生科学家谭卓川教授此前表示，这些都是有希望的。\n除了新加坡越来越擅长治疗Covid-19外，该病毒也有可能变得更温和，这可以解释为什么新的病例没有那么严重，Leong博士说。\n在中国的病例中，Covid-19的死亡率约为2.3%。相比之下，Sars的死亡率为92003年爆发期间为0.6%，而中东呼吸综合征（Mers）的死亡率为35%。\n中国境外的Covid-19的死亡率——基于少量死亡人数——仍然较低，约为0.2%，与猪流感相似，略高于季节性流感。\n潘杰斯托教授补充道：“这意味着什么？它仅仅证明了Covid-19的大多数病例并不严重，人们不应该过分担心。就像流感和兹卡一样。”\n大多数与中国无关的案件\n不过，专家们表示，最近几周出现了一个令人担忧的统计数字：无法追溯到中国大陆的病例已经超过了与中国有已知联系的病例。\n梁振英博士说，虽然这不值得惊慌，但事实上，大多数病例与中国没有任何联系，这表明新加坡已经非常接近失去控制从中国传播的病毒的能力。\n他说，强烈的接触追踪有助于控制这些数字，否则未知案件将继续增加。\n“第一轮感染来自中国。第二轮来自与中国人接触的当地人。这在任何正在流行的疾病中都是意料之中的。对第二组保持警惕是至关重要的，我们似乎已经做到了。\n但专家们认为，考虑到针对中国的旅游限制越来越多，可能会有更为隐蔽的事情发生。越来越多的人担心未被发现的Covid-19病例可能从其他国家进入新加坡。\n梁振英博士说：“在中国，这一数字正在下降，很好，病毒在源头（国家）的传播得到控制。但更重要的问题是，那些离开中国，播种到资源较少的国家的人，他们能承受住压力吗？”\nCovid-19例境外病例呈加速增长趋势. 自2月7日以来，中国境外发现的新病例数量稳步攀升，并于2月17日首次突破每日新增100例的门槛，此后一直居高不下。\n虽然在新加坡实施边境管制措施后，Covid-19在新加坡的进口病例数量微不足道，但库克教授预测，随着越来越多的从其他国家进口的病例在新加坡催生更多的集群，这一数字可能会再次攀升。\n他说：“正常情况下，来往新加坡和日本、泰国等地的旅行很多，这两个地方都有相当多的确诊病例。”。\n考虑到新加坡与马来西亚和印度尼西亚的距离和联系，库克副教授表示，他也担心未来从这两个国家进口的风险。印度尼西亚未发现任何Covid-19病例，不过哈佛大学的一项研究质疑这是否是由于其缺乏检测，而不是病毒的发病率。\n库克副教授说：“随着越来越多的病例在中国以外被观察到，现在庆祝还为时过早。”。\n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SIHANOUKVILLE (Cambodia) — Health authorities scrambled on Monday (Feb 17) to track hundreds of passengers who disembarked from a cruise ship in Cambodia last week after a woman tested positive for coronavirus, heightening fears about the spread of the disease around the world. \n The new case raises questions about how companies and countries should handle monitoring and quarantine for people who may have been exposed to the new virus, since the American woman from the Westerdam cruise ship had passed the usually presumed incubation period of 14 days. \n Holland America Line, which is owned by cruise giant Carnival Corp, said it is working with governments and health experts to track passengers. \n \"Guests who have already returned home will be contacted by their local health department and be provided further information,\" the company said in a statement. \n Nearly 200 passengers from the Westerdam have returned to their home countries after travelling through Malaysia and Thailand, authorities said, though none of them displayed any symptoms. \n Some 1,455 passengers and 802 crew first embarked on the cruise. It spent two weeks at sea after being turned away by Japan, Taiwan, Guam, the Philippines and Thailand even though the ship said there were no coronavirus cases aboard. \n In Cambodia, at least 236 passengers and 747 crew remain aboard the vessel off the port city of Sihanoukville, Holland America said. \n Several hundred other Westerdam passengers who left the ship are still in hotels in Cambodia and are being tested on Monday for coronavirus, according to passenger Holley Rauen, a public health nurse and midwife from Fort Myers, Florida. \n “Everyone is very nervous about results,” Ms Rauen said in a message to Reuters. “Some are grouchy but many still remain positive.\" \n ASYMPTOMATIC RISK \n It was not immediately clear how the American woman contracted the virus, but the positive test in Malaysia came after she had spent more than 14 days on the Westerdam, which departed from Hong Kong on Feb. 1. \n Passengers had been cleared to travel by Cambodian authorities when the cruise ship docked on Thursday. The company said passengers were tested regularly on board and Cambodia also tested 20 people once it docked, but not the woman who contracted the virus. \n Ms Raina MacIntyre, head of the Biosecurity Research Program at Australia's University of New South Wales, said it was well known the coronavirus can be infectious even if a patient has no symptoms. \n \"The Japanese tested over 500 of their first evacuees from Wuhan, whether they were symptomatic or not, and five out of eight positive tests were in asymptomatic people,\" Ms MacIntyre said. \"So, in a high risk setting, it would be important to check for infection in everyone.\" \n Holland America said it is working with health officials in Malaysia and Cambodia and experts in the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). \n Worries about the new virus have mounted even though it is believed to kill only around 1 per cent of people it infects, because of fears that with no natural immunity among the world's population, it could spread to infect millions if unchecked. \n The websites of both the CDC and WHO give an estimated incubation period for the virus of up to 14 days. \n Mr Adam Kamradt-Scott, infectious diseases expert at the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney, said a Chinese study of 1,099 patients indicated the incubation period could be as much as 24 days, but most people exhibited symptoms within three days. \n Anyone potentially exposed to the virus should self-isolate and notify health authorities if they start to exhibit symptoms, he said. \n \"We need people to be willing to come forward and not fear persecution or discrimination, as that will only serve to aid the virus’ spread.\" \n In Japan, another Carnival cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, has been quarantined since arriving in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, on Feb 3. As of Sunday, 355 people aboard have tested positive — by far the biggest cluster of cases outside China.

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — Three new cases of the novel coronavirus, Covid-19, have been confirmed in Singapore, while another patient has been discharged from hospital. \n Of the three new confirmed cases, two are linked to the cluster at Grace Assembly of God church — with one of them being a regular serviceman in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). \n In its press release on Sunday (Feb 16), MOH said that the serviceman has not gone to work since the onset of his symptoms. \n The total number of confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God church cluster is now 18. \n In a separate media statement, the Ministry of Defence said that the SAF regular who tested positive worked at Building 613 of Tengah Air Base. \n The serviceman last visited his place of work on Feb 6. As a precautionary measure, the SAF has since carried out immediate and thorough disinfection of the premises the serviceman had been in. \n As of Sunday, the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore is 75, with 19 having recovered from the virus. Five are in critical condition in the intensive care unit. \n LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND \n In its press release, MOH said that further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and the new confirmed cases. This was made possible with the assistance of the Singapore Police Force, MOH said. \n Cases 8 and 9, as well as Cases 31, 33 and 38, are linked to The Life Church and Missions Singapore (146B Paya Lebar Road). \n Nine of the confirmed cases (Cases 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 34 and 40) are linked to the cluster associated with health products shop Yong Thai Hang (24 Cavan Road off Lavender Street). \n Three of the confirmed cases (Cases 30, 36 and 39) are linked to the private business meeting held at Grand Hyatt Singapore from Jan 20 to 22. \n Five of the confirmed cases (Cases 42, 47, 52, 56 and 69) are linked to the Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site. \n Eighteen of the confirmed cases (Cases 48, 49, 51, 53, 54, 57, 58, 60, 61, 62, 63, 66, 67, 68, 70, 71, 73 and 74) are linked to the Grace Assembly of God church. \n The MOH said that investigations on these clusters are ongoing. In addition to the clusters, investigations have identified the following links between cases: \n Case 44, a 37-year-old Singaporean man who works at Certis Cisco Centre and had served Quarantine Orders on two people from Wuhan, was linked to Cases 13 and 26, a mother-and-daughter pair from Wuhan; \n Case 65, a 61-year-old Singaporean woman, is a family member of Case 50, a 62-year-old employee of DBS bank, and Case 55, a 30-year-old Singaporean man who works at Pulau Bukom and went to the Catholic Church of Christ the King; \n Case 72, a 40 year-old male Chinese national who is a Singapore work pass holder and has no recent travel history to China, is a non-medical contact of Case 59, a 61-year-old Singaporean man who works at a private hospital here; and \n Case 75, a 71-year-old Singaporean woman, is a family member of Case 41, a 71-year-old Singaporean man who visited Paya Lebar Methodist Church and a gathering at Braddell Heights Residents’ Committee.  \n The health ministry added that contact tracing is underway for the other seven locally transmitted cases to establish any links to previous cases or travel history to mainland China. \n  \n THE CONFIRMED CASES \n Case 73 \n Case 73 is a 43-year-old male Singaporean who did not go to China recently. \n He is warded in an isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). He is linked to the cluster at Grace Assembly of God. \n He reported onset of symptoms on Feb 9 and sought treatment at a general practitioner (GP) clinic on Feb 10. As he was identified as a close contact of Case 51 — a 41-year-old Singaporean man who worked at both the Tanglin and Bukit Batok churches of Grace Assembly of God — he was served a home quarantine order on Feb 13 and taken to NCID the next day. \n Test results confirmed Covid-19 infection on Feb 15 at noon. \n Before he was warded, he had attended church service at Grace Assembly of God (Tanglin). He is a regular serviceman in the SAF but had not gone to work since the onset of symptoms. He lives in the Toa Payoh Lorong 8 area. \n Case 74 \n Case 74 is a 29-year-old male Singaporean with no recent travel history to China. He is warded in an isolation room at Alexandra Hospital. He is linked to the cluster at Grace Assembly of God. \n He reported an onset of symptoms on Feb 12. He sought treatment at the Urgent Care Centre at Alexandra Hospital that day, and again on Feb 15 when he was admitted and immediately isolated. \n Test results confirmed Covid-19 infection on Feb 15 at noon. \n Before he was admitted to hospital, he had gone to work at Hi-Yew Technology (3031A Ubi Road). He lives along Mei Ling Street in Queenstown. \n Case 75 \n Case 75 is a 71-year-old female Singaporean with no recent travel history to China. \n She is a family member of Case 41 and had been under quarantine since Feb 7. She was confirmed to have Covid-19 infection on Feb 16 in the morning and is warded in an isolation room at NCID. \n Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing, said MOH. \n As of midday on Sunday, MOH has identified 2,179 close contacts. Of the 2,045 who are still in Singapore, 1,781 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining 264 close contacts. \n UPDATES ON PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED CASES \n Case 68 \n Case 68 is a 79-year-old female Singaporean with no recent travel history to China. \n She is warded in an isolation room at NCID and is a family member of Case 66, a 28-year-old Singaporean man who works at Grace Assembly of God. \n Before she was warded, she had attended church service at Bethany Presbyterian Church (364A Paya Lebar Road). She lives on Mei Hwan Drive near Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1. \n Case 69 \n Case 69 is a 26-year-old Bangladesh national who is a Singapore work pass holder, and has no recent travel history to China. \n He is warded in an isolation room at NCID. He is linked to the cluster at Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site. \n He had been identified as a close contact of Cases 42, 47, 52 and 56, who were all migrant workers from Bangladesh. He had been quarantined at a government quarantine facility from Feb 11. \n Case 70 \n Case 70 is a 27-year-old female Singaporean with no recent travel history to China. \n She is warded in an isolation room at NCID and is a family member of Case 66, a 28-year-old Singaporean man who works at Grace Assembly of God. \n Prior to hospital admission, she had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church (37 Jalan Pemimpin in Marymount), and gone to work at HipVan Singapore (19 Kallang Avenue). She lives on Mei Hwan Drive near Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1. \n Case 71 \n Case 71 is a 25-year-old male Singaporean with no recent travel history to China. \n He is warded in an isolation room at NCID. He is a contact of Case 66, a 28-year-old Singaporean man who works at Grace Assembly of God, and Case 70 above. \n Before he was warded, he had gone to work at a construction site along Fernvale Lane in Sengkang and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church. He lives on Fernvale Road. \n Case 72 \n Case 72 is a 40-year-old male Chinese national who is a Singapore work pass holder, and has no recent travel history to China. He is a non-medical contact of Case 59, a 61-year-old Singaporean man who works at a private hospital here. \n Before he was admitted to NCID on Feb 14, he had visited Marina Bay Sands Casino (10 Bayfront Avenue) and gone to work at Aim Heng Car Service (Woodlands Industrial Park). He stays at a rental apartment along Woodlands Crescent. \n   \n CLARIFICATION: A previous version of this article stated that Case 73 is a Republic of Singapore Air Force regular, according to an MOH press release.

        "news_content_translate_en": "The coronavirus outbreak has been very much in the news and, apart from its impact on public health and the economy, is also affecting investments. \n Investors should position their portfolio carefully and watch markets closely during this period. \n IMPACT ON STOCK MARKETS \n Concerns about the Covid-19 coronavirus in various countries continue to roil the markets with a heavy dose of volatility, financial advisory firm ETF Database observed. \n British newspaper The Guardian reported that financial markets remain confident the crisis will soon blow over, as share prices have been rebounding because investors think the coronavirus can be contained. \n Yet, it also noted that Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser to insurance company Allianz, thinks that the economic damage could be a black swan event equivalent to the collapse of the US sub-prime mortgage market. \n Black swan events is a term popularised by writer Nassim Taleb and based on a saying that black swans did not exist (until they were discovered in the wild). \n They are events that come as a complete surprise, have profound consequences and are rationalised by people who never saw the crisis coming and who then say after the fact that it was glaringly obvious that there was trouble ahead.  \n The epidemic in China caused by coronavirus Covid-19 and the infections spreading in other countries have already become a black swan event for the Asia-Pacific tourism industry, business information company IHS Markit says. It could hit other sectors as well. \n MARKET FORECASTS \n While investors understandably want to know what to do at this time of uncertainty. financial advisory firm Evergreen Gavekal’s adviser Arthur Kroebel says that it is a “fool’s errand” to come up with highly specific forecasts for the ultimate impact on Chinese, regional or global gross domestic product (GDP) given the uncertainties involved. \n If it does turn into a global pandemic, he said, global supply chains would face more disruption, commodity prices would fall more severely, and central banks would face pressure to offset the impact.  \n Already, though, financial services firm ING expects that potential spreading of the virus across the globe could last until March or April and mark a new downside risk to the global economy in the first half of 2020. \n Investment bank JP Morgan said that the coronavirus remains in its early stages and “is likely to worsen before getting better”. \n Here in Singapore, DBS bank said that the outbreak has thrown the Singapore economy a curveball. \n Supply chain disruptions such as extended factory closures within China will have a significant impact on Singapore’s manufacturing sector, for example, and consumer spending is expected to be dampened as residents take more precautionary actions in their daily lives. \n As a result, “we are downgrading our 2020 real GDP forecast to 0.9% (from 1.4%) in response to the potential impact. The concern is that the impact could be deeper than Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome).” \n Over in Hong Kong, The Guardian said that the economy risks being plunged deeper into recession as the outbreak wreaks havoc, with consumers panic-buying staple goods and airlines stopping flights.   POSITION YOUR PORTFOLIO PROTECTIVELY \n Amid all these uncertainties, a key question for investors is how to position their investment portfolio well and prepare effectively for whatever the next several months may bring. \n “When you don’t know,” Mr Ray Dalio, founder of hedge-fund giant Bridgewater Associates told MarketWatch, “the best investment strategy is to be smartly diversified across geographic locations, asset classes, and currencies.” \n So far, he said, “fears of the spreading coronavirus have triggered a ‘flight-to-quality’ that continues to pressure stocks while giving a lift to hedges such as gold, bonds and the (US) dollar.” \n British financial research firm Trustnet similarly said that some investors have started taking more defensive positions, with government bonds and gold being preferred options. \n For stocks, it could be advantageous to avoid vulnerable companies in the tourism sector such as airlines and cruise lines or hotels and to buy companies such as e-commerce or food delivery firms that will benefit even if consumers stay at home. \n Investors can also benefit by taking advantage of shifts in the market. \n While JPMorgan Chase analysts noted that previous global health scares such as Sars and Zika did not unsettle equities for an extended period, the MSCI Hong Kong index lost about 9 per cent during the Sars epidemic and then jumped17 per cent in the three months after the disease faded from view. \n Investment brokerage Schwab similarly said that although there is always a chance that this outbreak could have greater consequences, the global economy and markets have been relatively immune to the effects of past viral epidemics. “A short-term dip in stocks tended to be followed by the continuation of the upward trend,” it said. \n While there is uncertainty about the impact on investments and a panicked rush to buy less risky assets is not appropriate, investors would be well-advised to examine their portfolio and ensure that it is sufficiently diversified. \n Given the uncertainties, it could also be advisable to take a more defensive posture than usual over the next several months and increase the allocation to investments in bonds while reducing the allocation to stocks and potentially shifting the types of stocks in the portfolio. \n Even though the timing of an upturn is uncertain, watching trends and taking advantage of dips to buy if markets rebound could also be beneficial. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "NEW YORK (NYTIMES) - If the rate of growth in coronavirus cases in the New York metro area continues, it will suffer a more severe outbreak than those experienced in Wuhan, China, or the Lombardy region of Italy. \n There is no guarantee, of course, that current trends will continue. What has happened to this point can't be used to predict what will happen next. It is possible that social distancing will soon slow or arrest the growth of cases. \n But what can be said is that the New York metro area has had less success in flattening the curve, at this point in its outbreak, than Wuhan or the Lombardy region did at the same point in theirs. And some other American metropolitan areas appear to be on a similar path. \n In the early stages of an outbreak, the population size doesn't matter - one infected person will probably infect a few people, whether that person lives in a metropolitan area of 100,000 or one of 10 million. But as an epidemic progresses, the number of cases per capita can provide a good measure of the prevalence of coronavirus in a community. Per capita measurements also give a sense of how strained a community's health care system has become, since larger places tend to have more medical resources. \n To make useful per capita comparisons, we've focused on metropolitan areas instead of countries or US states. That's because metropolitan areas roughly correspond with the regions where the virus might spread quickly among families, co-workers or commuters. Health resources also tend to be local. \n Our tables include numbers from Lombardy and Wuhan to provide a benchmark for metro areas in the United States. The comparisons are illustrative, but not exact. Those outbreaks have been going on longer, which means their case numbers are spread over more time. In most of the US, cases are from only the last month. \n The number of confirmed cases is an imperfect measure of what we really care about: the prevalence of the virus in the population, and therefore - if it is early in the epidemic - how many people are sick or may be contagious. The limited availability of testing in some places means that many people with coronavirus won't be counted among the confirmed cases. And the varying rates of testing across states and countries make it hard to compare the number of confirmed cases in different regions. \n Examining deaths can allow for a more direct comparison between communities, since it avoids many of the problems with variable testing. Testing differences matter less in measuring deaths because in most places with established outbreaks in the United States, the sickest patients are getting tested. That may be less true in other parts of the world: Patients who die outside hospitals in Britain and Italy have, in some cases, been omitted from official data. \n But measuring only deaths has drawbacks, too. We know that the death rate from coronavirus differs depending on the age and health of the populations affected and the availability of medical resources, like ventilators. That means that per capita rates may look high in places where the virus has infiltrated nursing homes, for example, even if it has not spread widely through the rest of the community. \n \n<!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--\niFrameResize()\n//--><!]]>\n \n Because patients who die of Covid-19 tend to be sick for weeks first, counting deaths may also understate the current size of the outbreak in a given place if it is growing quickly. \n To assess the possible future of the outbreak, it's helpful to look not just at the number of cases but also at how quickly they are increasing. \n Public health officials have been talking about the value of social distancing measures as a way to \"flatten the curve\" of the epidemic. Such a flattening would mean that the rates are falling, eventually to zero. New York's current growth rate is just over 30 per cent, suggesting that its curve remains quite steep, and that the disease is continuing to spread rapidly throughout the region. \n In some other places, like Baton Rouge, the growth rate is high, but the number of cases is still low. That means the community may still have time to flatten its curve before the outbreak becomes widespread. But communities with a lot of cases and a high growth rate are on track to have a serious problem. A high growth rate on top of a large number of cases means that a still larger number of people are on track to become ill or die. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "BEIJING • China's aviation regulator will support restructuring or mergers to help airlines cope with the coronavirus outbreak, it said yesterday, noting that the epidemic has hurt the bottom lines of many carriers. \n The epidemic, which originated in the transportation hub city of Wuhan and quickly spread to the rest of China, has caused global airlines to cancel thousands of flights after dozen of countries imposed travel restrictions amid virus fears, dampening demand. The disease was named Covid-19 on Tuesday. \n On Tuesday, airlines cancelled 12,662 flights in China, according to aviation data provider Variflight. \n The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) will continue to lobby the authorities to subsidise airlines hurt by travel curbs due to the coronavirus, CAAC spokesman Xiong Jie told a media briefing, adding that more fees would be waived for carriers. \n The regulator will also support restructuring and mergers among airlines based on their needs, and support them to optimise capacity so they can weather the difficult time and win the battle against the virus, the spokesman said. \n Discussions of possible mergers have swirled since conglomerate HNA Group, which owns Hainan Airlines, started experiencing liquidity issues, said Chinese aviation expert Li Xiaojin. \n Mr Li added that small airlines such as Lucky Air and Okay Airways were looking to get acquired. \n \"But the issue is the airlines looking to be bought were asking for a high price... After the outbreak, everyone is having difficulties, but small airlines may struggle more, so it's possible for them to lower their asking prices,\" Mr Li said. \n Passenger traffic in China declined 5.3 per cent last month from a year earlier, compared with a growth rate of 7.9 per cent for last year. \n \"The coronavirus has had a huge impact on the civil aviation industry, which resulted in significant reductions in flight volume and could create new or spill-over safety risks,\" Mr Xiong said. \n The CAAC hopes countries will lift virus-related travel restrictions as soon as possible, in line with guidance from the World Health Organisation and International Civil Aviation Organisation, said CAAC official Liang Nan. \n For international flights affected by the coronavirus, the CAAC, in communication with other aviation authorities, will strive to retain the rights and landing slots for airlines, Mr Liang said, adding that flights would be restored as soon as possible when market demand returns. \n REUTERS \n ",

This device could provide around 40 billion dollars [35,7 billion euros] for emerging markets that could potentially address us for financial support\", further stated Kristalina Georgieva.\nReferring that overall, the Fund has a financing capacity of about one,0 billion dollars (893 billion dollars), and also the Disaster Relief and Containment Fund (FCAC), which provides the eligible countries with advances for relief from debt service to the IMF.\n\"The FCAC proved effective during the Ebola outbreak in 2014, but is now under-financed with just over 200 million dollars [about 178,5 million euros], against possible needs of more than one.000 million [about 893 million euro]\" warned the responsible party responsible.Yeah.\nKristalina Georgieva asked \"Member States to help ensure that this device is fully recharged and prepared for the current crisis\".\nThe leader of the IMF had already warned at the same conference that the contagion hitting supply and demand circuits \"demands a worldwide response\", and that in 2020 world growth will be lower than that of 2019, although it is \"difficult to predict how much\".\nThe 189 IMF Member States promised to give \"all the support necessary to limit the impact\" of the epidemic, in particular in the most vulnerable countries, following a teleconference by the International Monetary and Financial Committee of the Fund.\n\"We ask the IMF to use all the financial instruments at its disposal to help the Member States in need,\" says a statement, which also states that there is'confidence'in being able to overcome the crisis and'restore growth'.\nThe Covid-19 outbreak, detected in December in China, which can cause respiratory infections such as pneumonia, caused about three.300 deaths and infected more than 95 thousand people in 79 countries, including nine in Portugal.\nFrom infected people, more than fifty thousand have recovered.\nIn addition to three.012 killed in China, there are reports of fatalities in Iran, Italy, South Korea, Japan, France, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia, Thailand, the United States of America and the Philippines, San Marino, Iraq, Switzerland and Spain.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the Covid-19 outbreak an international public health emergency and increased the risk to \"very high\".",
